0,"I've bought this for my nieces and my mom. My older niece went through 2 of them, my other niece still has her first one as well as my mom.I noticed that my older niece would carry it in her backpack for school and would eventually break (the screen panel would break off, on both of them). My other niece's Chromebook finally broke (as she started to take it to school with her), same thing, the screen panel broke, but it still turns on and everything.My mom's Chromebook still works and no broken screen panel. My nieces' Chromebooks broke from being carried in their backpacks (used and abused) while my mom keeps her on the kitchen table at all times. As long as you don't carry it around, you shouldn't have any issues. If you plan to carry it around, so your best to handle with care.

1,"My Chromebook came in the mail a few days ago, and I've been using it pretty much the entire time since. First of all, when I first took it out of the box and booted it up for the first time, it was really buggy, the touchpad was wonky, things loaded very slowly, and it was just really bad. However after I shut it down and rebooted it (all of which took only 15 seconds by the way, which is fantastic), I was told that Chrome was now downloading a ""critical update."" After this, things have just been amazing. This really is a testament to how far and fast Chrome has and can improve. Plus, there's an update for Chrome every ~6 weeks which just makes things absolutely amazing.  KEYBOARD: in a word, amazing. The island- style chiclet keys have great travel and feedback, are extremely comfortable and easy to type on, and within the first 30 minutes of using the Chromebook I was typing error free and at my usual speed. The keyboard is probably one of the best features of this laptop. There's also function keys up top that control brightness, volume, and various other things, which is really handy.  TRACKPAD: I love this. It feels great and works just like the trackpad on higher-end machines. Two-finger scrolling works great, and while there is the occasional hiccup where it doesn't register the second finger, it's a very minor thing and doesn't happen often. There's also three/four finger gestures that allow you to navigate between different tabs if you swipe left/right on the trackpad with three/four fingers. And as expected, there's tap-to-click as well as standard press-trackpad-to-click. My only wish is that Google/Samsung would add pinch-to-zoom gesture on the trackpad.  BATTERY: in addition to the keyboard, this is one of the shining features of the Chromebook. As a test, I used it today from 12:45 PM nonstop until 6:10 PM, browsing, reading, and watching tv shows. I bet if I didn't stream any video it could've lasted even longer. There's no question whether or not this will last a full day of work/school- it definitely will. And if you're working offline, maybe on the train or on the bus, it'll probably last even longer. The battery is wonderful- one of the reasons why I chose the Samsung Chromebook over the Acer C7 version, which has an estimated battery life of only 3 hours.  SCREEN: very standard. It definitely is usable, sure, but it's not going to blow your socks off with colors, resolution, or anything like that. It gets the job done, and the matte finish helps it with glare, but the brightness has to be set at about 75-80% brightness to view comfortably.  CHROME OS: a mixed bag. If you're comfortable with Chrome already and already use Google's vast suite of online products (i.e Gmail, Youtube, Maps, Drive, Search, Translate etc) you'll have no problem with it. However, if you depend on desktop programs such as Photoshop, CAD, offline MS Office (there's SkyDrive which is basically MS's online word processing program- sort of like what Google's Drive does), you'll either have to find basic replacements from the Chrome Web Store, or simply make do without them. Not only that, once you're offline your Chromebook's functionality is severely limited. You can still edit and create documents and such on (offline enabled) Drive, and view and compose new emails on the Offline Gmail app, and some other things if you find the right app for it, but mostly, there isn't much you can do once you're out of range of a WiFi hotspot. If you plan on using this at home 24/7 however, this shouldn't be a problem.  BUILD QUALITY: not very good. While the plastic is solid and feels sturdy enough, it's very easily scratched, so it's best to purchase a sleeve or case of some sort to keep it safe whenever you're not using it. In fact, it's so easily scratched, I've already found three or four scuffs and scratches on the top and bottom even though I've literally carried it around on a pillow, and used it on top of the foam that came in the packaging. Very unpleasant. But for the price, I guess that's a tradeoff you'll have to live with.  WRAPUP: I'm very pleased with this. It works like I expected, has great battery life and keyboard quality, and although the screen isn't that good, and the build quality is less than stellar, they're two things I'll just have to live with. Just know what you're buying, folks. This isn't an ultrabook nor is it even a standard laptop. It's a Chromebook, and if you buy this expecting to GET a Chromebook, you'll be quite happy. Don't buy this expecting the same functionality of a full-blown Windows or OSX machine, because you will be disappointed. For it's purpose, it's a great device.  However, I have recently come across some complaints online about the screen spontaneously breaking on its own without even being touched or dropped or damaged in the least. I have no idea what might cause this, and my Chromebook seems to have no problem so far, but I really hope those are isolated occurrences.  I'll update this review as time passes if anything comes up, or if my views change, but until then feel free to leave any questions you guys might have. I'll try to help the best I can!-------------------UPDATE 1:  I recently bought a case for my Chromebook- it's called the iPearl mCover case. It's a snap-on plastic shell for the top and bottom, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to protect their Chromebook. This laptop on its own feels very thin and flimsy, but now it's much more solid with the case on it. I've also written a review on the case on the product listing here: iPearl mCover Hard Shell Case for 11.6"" Samsung Chromebook (Wi-Fi or 3G) laptop - CLEAR (and for anyone wondering, I am not advertising for this company. This is my honest experience with their product).-------------------UPDATE 2:  After using the Chromebook for multiple months, I can safely say that this is a great computer who does the majority of their work online. The battery life continues to be great, with 5-6 hours of continuous use (or about 3 when streaming video). One complaint I have is how the Chromebook ships with a proprietary charger (micro-USB port like the HP Chromebook 11 would have been far more handy and convenient). The keyboard keys and trackpad feel as responsive and clicky as ever as well, and everything in general has been great even after extended use. I have not experienced the 'spontaneous screen crack' that other people have been victims of, for which I am very glad. It seems those issues really are only limited to earlier models, and that the build quality issues have been ironed out.

2,"I was so excited about the Chromebook. I bought it to replace my old laptop, which doesn't comes on anymore. I'm a college student and don't really need anything major just for typing my papers and getting on the web. I wasn't planning on using this for gaming or anything thing like that. So far I've had this for a couple of months and sadly tonight is the the first time I needed to print something from it. All the other times I printed from school, anyways what I found out is that I can't use a classic printer to print from here. Meaning I CANNOT plug a printer on to here and print. I have to either buy a Cloud Ready Printer or use a PC as a host. TO us my PC as a host, the PC that doesn't turns on anymore, I would have to download the cloud print software and then have the PC on every time I need to Print. WTH is that!!! I promise if I would've known I had to go through this much to do a basic computer function then I've gotten the ACER. But by all means if you have a laptop that can be your host or a Cloud Ready Printer then this is a overall good computer...well so far. I regret waiting so long to figure this out because now I can't return it.

3,"Great product for the 1st 364 days. I bought it to be disposable and Samsung did not disappoint!Excellent battery life. Good performance/durability. Very Slim/Lightweight.Back to the reason I gave it 2/5 stars(reduced from 5/5)My Chromebook had a TPM failure ~1 week before manufacturer warranty expired. Samsung's customer support was a 5/10 on this issue at best. My opinion was it seemed like they considered dealing with their quality issue to be an unfortunate chore rather than an opportunity to restore confidence in their brand. Very disappointing experience.Assume designed obsolescence when purchasing this product and do not expect their warranty department to be eager to correct their mistakes if they find themselves liable for a repair. Credit where credit is due: the return shipping to California was very fast, however I resented that they refused to pay for residential pick-up(making it my problem to drop off the package).World's smallest violin and all that, but their handling of the situation was already unsatisfactory. :/ Squaretrade warranty can resolve some of these issues, although the need for a secondary warranty is a hidden cost which should be considered when purchasing goods from Samsung. If I wanted customer support to treat me like a nuisance I would buy my laptops from Acer. I have no illusions about their brand(they charged for recovery DVDs last I checked) so I'm glad Samsung finds themselves in good company(I used to consider them on a higher level)!For comparison, if Harbor Freight was this tight-fisted I would shop at Home Depot. I don't make returns often but I buy enough cheap garbage that I know better than to pinch pennies by going though suppliers that don't stand by their products when they break. If I wanted ""Caveat Emptor"" I'd knock another 30% off the sticker and buy through Chinavasion/DealExtreme/Alibaba Express. I wouldn't be surprised if their customer support was actually BETTER than Samsung so I don't want to insult them by making a comparison.If Samsung wants to compete with Apple they should increase their prices by 5%, and add a week to their designed obsolescence. Then they can have as much contempt for their customers as they want because their products will fail under warranty so rarely that their only job will be to recommend that their customers ""should have bought the extended warranty if they wanted it to last 366+ days"".I blacklist brands for years when they burn me on customer support. Maybe I'll try another one of their products in ~2018 after their shareholders have had some time to cry over sales figures.

4,"I've used Windows products nearly my entire life and have grown tired of the OS BS so when I saw Samsung, a company I trust, had a netbook with Chrome OS, I decided to try it out since I was already using Chrome web browser on my Windows 8 laptop because I hate IE and Firefox was pissing me off.Pros:(1) Google Docs/Drive - I use this feature all the time, and love how I don't have to worry about the hard drive crashing and taking all my hard work with it. Yes, backing it up is the name of the game with Windows, and something I do religiously, but there are always exceptions (one time both my hard drive and the external drive I had went kaput around the same time, causing me to lose a year's worth of docs). Now, I don't have to worry because not only is it in the cloud, it's also accessible anywhere I go on any computer. On the netbook, it's own app located on the taskbar so really easy to just click and start writing without any hassle of looking for it.(2) Search. This is something that not everyone will like because of how we've been trained, but the left enter button was changed into a search button, so whenever you hit it, a search box with apps menu pops up. It doesn't bother me because I""m right handed and hit the right enter key with my pinky, but it might take some getting used to for lefties or people who use that particular button.(3) Chrome. I'm a big fan of this web browser already, so the ease of access just makes it even better for me. I have two separate Gmail accounts, and use both on the Chromebook., As a result, I have two different sets of apps and uses, much like Windows user accounts.(4) Battery life. My laptop is an Acer with only 4 hours of battery life, so I always have to carry a charger with me and hope I'm near a convenient socket to plug in. So far with this Chromebook, I've gone at least 8 hours with heavy use (I run an e-commerce store so I'm online constantly) and don't need to worry about the charge until I get home.(5) Browsing. I won't lie, this isn't the fastest I've ever used, but it works for what I need. Right now I have about 25 tabs open in 3 windows and haven't had any problems switching between them.Cons:(1) The keyboard. Now, this isn't really a big deal for me since I have small hands, but I know my boyfriend has problems typing on it, and I miss the side number keys.(2) Chromecast casting tab. Again, not a huge problem, but quality does suffer when I'm watching Amazon Prime shows while having a bunch of tabs open. (This only applies to people who own Chromecast so skip if you have no idea what I'm talking about).(3) Mouse. I've never liked touch pads and have always used wireless mice with my laptops. This time, however, I have opted to learn how to use it and for the most part I've learned to work with it, though I would recommend watching the tutorial or reading through the instructions to get full use out of it. Maybe with more practice this will turn from a con into a pro.I've only had this for a little over a week, so I haven't found more cons, but so far I really love this netbook because it does what I need it to do and gets it done with less hassle than Windows at a better price than even budget laptops. Is this Chromebook for everyone? No way, but it's definitely a great option for those who don't need the full array of a laptop and just want an easy way to browse.

5,"I have my chromebook for over two years and I love it.  However, it wasn't love at first site as I had to learn how to use it as it is different from PC traditional applications, Chromebooks run Web-based apps, and I am not very 'techy', I had to understand the chrome operating system.  I use it for a lot of writing but it also loads quickly to the internet, great for Facebook games, storage is on cloud, I can print from cloud from it as well, no need to worry about viruses, many free apps available.  Now I can transfer files from my Dell PC to my chrome and back as I have Word and Excel apps.  It's lightweight so I not only plug-in on my back deck to work but battery life sufficient (about 5-6 hours) to take to the park and work in nice weather.This is not my main computer, but my Dell is too heavy to take whenever and wherever I travel so this is great for me.I do need to add that I use the Logitech WiFi mouse because it's more comfortable for me.

6,"I would guess you are either a fan of chromebooks or not, or perhaps you are just curious about what they are and how they work.  I bought my first chromebook used off ebay summer of 2012 and it became a staple around my house.  It took a while for it to catch on with all the family members. but once it did, it saw a lot of use.  There is currently 4 of us living at home and we have 7 other laptops in the house as well as a 7 inch android tablet and 4 large screen android smart phones.  Even with all these other internet access tools handy the chromebook is very well used and loved by all.  It really does do most of what we want and it is quick and simple to use.  If fact, my oldest son who is away at college needed something to take to class with him, so I offered to send him the chromebook since I could easily slip it into a padded envelope and send it on it's way.  I woke up the next morning regretting my decision so much that I immediately started looking for a new chromebook.  I just found everything else such a bother that every time I wanted to do something on the internet, I just didn't, becauseI did not have my chromebook handy.  That's when I bought this one.  My first chromebook was the first series Samsung, so I stuck with the Samsung line, and I am very happy with it.  I just love the form factor and simple design.  Everything on it works just the way I want it to.  I've had a lot of laptops over the years and I do not know that I have ever had one I enjoy as much as my chromebook.  It cannot do everything my full featured laptops do, but it does do most of what I need and what it can do it does very well.

7,"While the Samsung Chromebook won't do everything a laptop will do, after using it for a month, I've found it's almost as good. And for the price, you can't beat it.First, the good. It's relatively cheap. It's extremely light, and I can carry it anywhere. It's no heavier than a typical tablet. It's a very sharp looking little machine. As everyone says, you open it up, and it automatically starts right up in no time at all. No bloated and expensive operating system to load here. The screen size suits me fine, and the sound is okay. There's only 16G of storage, but with with an SD card slot and two USB connections, you really have as much storage as you need. Need more storage? Just buy another SD card.It's Google-centric of course, so you're automatically signed into all your Google accounts - gmail, youtube, drive and so on. Obviously, nothing is truly secure and private in the cloud, but I find using Drive for writing documents to be extremely convenient. No need to worry about losing anything, it's always up there in the cloud. I can get to my documents from my phone, my Nexus, or any connected computer, anywhere I go. You can also work on your documents if you happen to be offline, and it will auto-save locally and update to the cloud as soon as you're connected again. Again, really convenient.Like most people, I often use my computer to surf the net. I've been using Chrome for a long time, and it works well on the Chromebook, naturally. It's also easy to view photos with the Chromebook, whether your pictures are on an SD card, or on the Chromebook drive.As quickly as the Chromebook starts, it's just as quick shutting down. No need to twiddle your thumbs waiting for the OS to do its housekeeping. So far, the battery seems to be more than adequate. No problem there.So far, the only negative (and the only reason for just 4 stars) is printing. I haven't been able to get my Chromebook to work with my printer, and I don't think Cloud printing will be of any use for me. If I could print with my Chromebook, it's an easy 5 stars.  I do use Eclipse to develop software, and the Chromebook isn't able to run Eclipse. Not a problem though.This is a great little machine, and for the price, can't be beat. I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.

8,"I based my purchase mainly on student Ryan's review: http://www.amazon.com/review/R3966S6WAKIHI3I have had my Samsung for a month and love it. There are some key items to understand. You need to know what this device does, what it doesn't, and don't try to compare it to something it can not compete with. Want a $2000 Macbook? Then don't expect a $240 Chromebook to be the same and review it poorly based on that.This is a $240 device that operates way beyond what should be expected. I use this mainly for school as well, and have not hit one snag in daily use. I do not need it to do high end graphics, video or anything else. I am a sophisticated user with 20+ years of experience. Here are some things I do daily, often all at the same time: Tumblr, reddit, Evernote, Google drive, gmail, Outlook 365, Kindle cloud reader, spotify, facebook, linkedin, Westlaw (work specific application), text editor, adn hootsuite. Here is a quick rundown of what works and the few lacking items:PROS- This thing is LIGHT. I carry it around, open, in the library while doing legal research without blinking. It is easily a one handed device. Think tablet....with a keyboard.- The keyboard. The biggest beef in the world is that laptops can have a seriously sketchy keyboard. This one is springy, tight, and responsive. Very nice.- Yes you need to be online, but everything I have needed has an offline feature. Document editing, storage, Chrome apps, Evernote. You are not as limited as you might think- Battery. WOW. This thing pounds at 6-8 hours easy without charging.- Ports. Two USB (one is 3.0), and HDMI (are you kidding me?) SD slot, and headphones. Perfect.- Screen. Honestly, for the money, the screen is great. It is very solid quality and is plenty bright enough (although lowering brightness extends the battery even more)- Wireless. Wireless is not a universal truth. Some wireless devices have awful ability to pick up signals. I have areas that are known wireless black holes for my phone and other devices. This has a fantastic ability to connect and hold a signal. Very impressed.- There have been reports of the track pad having poor reaction. I have not seen that at all. In fact, the track pad has gestures and is responsive for me.CONS- Keyboard. I only wish the keyboard had a backlight. I think that should actually be universal!- Track pad. The track pad is fine, but it is a bit loud when you click. I mean LOUD! Otherwise it is fine.- Speed. I am not sure I can complain about this, but the device is a bit laggy. I know. I know. $240. Still, it is a hair slow on response sometimes. I am reaching here.- SD slot. The SD card slot is a great feature and I was excited to triple my local space with a 32 GB card, however, the design of this slot is not good. The card literally sticks out almost 3/4 an inch. I was hoping for it to house into the laptop and I would never see it.Overall, I recommend this device to EVERYONE. I have already slated to get one for my daughter for Christmas and speak to people daily who notice it. It works great, especially at this price point and I honestly do not worry about it much. All my work is automatically backed up due to its nature and I can access everything I need. Think about it. Depending on how mobile you are, you consistently have to think about protecting your $3,000 Macbook from damage or being stolen. I never worry about this with my great Chromebook. I mean, why even add bulk with a case? Who cares? I highly recommend this product.

9,"7/24/2013:  This thing is proving to be durable.  I have dropped it once and had my bag smashed numerous times.  The only draw back is the lack of clear path to Microsoft Exchange for Outlook which I use for my company's email and calendar.  I have on-line access via Web Mail but it is not the same.  The smaller form factor and nearly instant are still its best features.  The Chrome browser gets better with every monthly revision.  Still an unbeatable bargain.6/12/2013:  This car charger Universal Netbook Car Charger is an incredible buy.  Now I can keep my Chromebook fully charged while driving on long trips.  This thing is only $5.99 via Prime and is the best built charger I have ever purchased.  See my review of it.Main ReviewI bought my Chromebook used in ""Like New"" condition from Amazon Warehouse Deals for $189.  It had a dented and opened box but it appeared to be unused.This review will focus on daily use from a traveling salesman.  I fly once per week and stay 3 nights per week in hotels.  My goal is to have something light, quick to start, easy to use, and fulfill my basic tasks.I unpacked it, plugged in the charger, turned it on, logged into my  Google account, launched Chrome, signed into my wifi, and started surfing.  I did not read anything to get started.I have a 13"" Toshiba laptop, a 10"" Toshiba Thrive Tablet, and Droid 2 cell phone.  This device is rapidly replacing everything but the cell.  Since I use the cell to tether the Chromebook for internet access when needed the are now a pair.I use this to surf, read both gmail and corporate Exchange email, do light spreadsheets, word docs, and even power point in their Google Docs equivalent programs, read Kindle books (which are down loadable), and listen to streamed music and down loaded to the SD card music.  I can even stream Amazon Prime and Netflix.  I have also accessed my corporate reports on a COGNOS system.I have paired it via bluetooth with a mouse and keyboard and hooked it to my 50"" plasma tv and played Angry Birds.  I also opened some web pages, printed them via Google Cloud Print, and downloaded them to read later.This by far the best technology buy I have ever made.hint: use ""swap enable"" for better performance, make sure download some apps, books, and games for offline use.I will update periodically as I try it over a range uses , apps, and settings,May 22:  Two days on the road:  This thing is light and thin which makes it easy to carry.  Used it on a 2 hour flight with no wifi and read a downloaded book and worked on a letter and a spreadsheet.  Loved the way it fires up in about 30 seconds.  Logged onto hotel wifi and streamed Amazon and Netflix with no problems.  Added some more apps and downloaded Angry Birds for offline play.  Have not found a way to store music internally so I am buying a micro usb card (the kind that barely protrude from the slot).  Next thing up is to figure out how to download some email for offline use and trying out Office 365.  I went two days of light use never turning it off and I still have 30% battery.May 30:  Duh, downloaded music into Google Play Music for offline listening.  It is very basic but good enough for the very little time I am not streaming Slacker.  I am finding mixed reviews on using 365 on a Chromebook so for now I am learning to live with Google Docs and use my Win8 laptop for just very intense spreadsheets.June 11:  Office 365 can only be used online and not installed on a Chromebook.  Office Apps by Microsoft is free if you have Microsoft Skydrive.  It is ran online but it is real Office programs with all the functionality most users will need.  I would not recommend Google docs for document creation but it is fine for light editing. So I now use my Win 7 laptop, anchored in my office, for MS Office document creation, use Google Docs offline if I must edit while away from wifi which is very rare, and use Office Apps while on the road with wifi.  Which means the Chrome is still my road device of choice.  The instant on and small form factor make it irresistible.Wifi/Bluetooth tethering via my droid is working great so I almost never am without web access.Durability is fine.  It survived a 4 ft fall to the floor. No problem.Started using a 32gb micro usb drive a ""Cruzer Fit"". Very small and lets me carry all my files.

You can add as many users as you want - each gets their unique space. It is just a browser but most of the work these days are done on a browser. Hangouts - Camera gives very clear image. More useful if using google phone number as we can answer calls within the system. As a user of all these features (have been using GrandCentral phone number before Google bought it), this book compliments my work and hobbies.

11,"I bought the Chromebook for my first year of graduate school as a supplemental computer to my HP Pavilion laptop. I was worried about bringing my $1000 laptop to lab since I'm a Microbiology Masters student. The last thing I wanted was to get some bacteria or deadly virus on my laptop and have to worry about sterilizing it, or spilling buffer all over the laptop and have it short-circuit. Instead, the Chromebook, a much cheaper alternative built around saving everything to the Cloud, will be taking its place.The first thing to realize is, this is NOT a full-spec performance PC. But I didn't buy it to act as such so I was more than impressed with the Chromebook for these reasons:Pros:- 9+ hours of battery life (if brightness isn't all the way up. My record is 9.5 hours so far of class time use)- Responsive keyboard (doesn't feel too cheap, keys can take a good beating)- Quick to start up and good processor (don't expect it to have stunning graphics or console quality game capabilities, but it's perfect for note taking and presentations)- Small and lightweight (fits very easily into a draw-string backpack)- Rather robust construction (being clumsy, I accidentally dropped this within the first week of getting it. Despite the 5 foot fall, it only suffered a single minor scratch and was otherwise completely okay. I wouldn't recommend dropping it every day, but good to know it can take an occasional bump or drop)- Extra storage capacity (the 16GB built-in is nice for papers, but any pictures or movies would bog down it's small solid state HD. The free 100GB Google Drive storage is very handy! Once that offer expires, I plan on getting a 64GB SD card that will just remain in the expansion slot 24/7)Cons:- I made the mistake of uploading powerpoints from one of my lectures to Google Drive without converting them to Google's format. When I got to class, I could only view the powerpoint and could not edit or access the note function at the bottom of the slides. I had assumed that it would open in Google Slides or convert it automatically but I was unable to convert the slides on the Chromebook. (The conversion problem could have been a result of the school's internet, which I swear is from the stone age, as downloading a 14MB file takes 5+ minutes, so I'm sure converting it via Google Drive takes about the same time). Lesson learned, make sure you have the important files converted to Google's format prior to heading to your meeting/class.Overall, you get an excellent machine for around $250. It isn't meant to compete with a full time desktop PC or a performance laptop, but it doesn't need to. It by far beats out any laptop in battery life, and is on par in terms of keyboard functionality and word processing capabilities. I've more than enjoyed it so far this semester, and I will keep you updated if I continue to love it throughout the school year.

12,"For web browsing in bed or on the couch, this smokes a tablet as far as I am concerned. I like the real keyboard, the chrome OS, the 10 second startup time (literally and consistently).The bad: I listen to a lot of music online while I browse and the sound quality is not as good as a full-blown, high quality laptop or tablet. I don't think most people would notice the lower quality of sound, but I did notice less ""fullness"" of sound when it was plugged into a stereo and into headphones when compared to iPads or my wife's Nexus 10. But I can buy TWO of these for the price of one of those! So that is a pretty specific and narrow ""minus."" Still, I guess I wouldn't suggest one of these as the media base for a home entertainment system.Also: Chrome OS is limited to its own ""app store."" So it won't run games or other programs written for Windows, unless the publisher has created a version specifically for the Chrome OS. NOTE: this is CHROME OS and NOT ANDROID. Even though I knew this when I bought it, I kept thinking I was going to be able to put Android apps on it, and you can't. It also does not run Java! So a friend of mine who bought one to gain access to his work through a web page was out of luck because his employer's portal uses Java.But for web browsing and casual music and news listening, I love this. It charges quickly and runs for a good long time on a charge. I use mine for over an hour a day, almost every day.

It does not have windows operating system so if that's what your used to then you may not want to stray to this laptop. This is pretty much just google based but it does have many apps in it to choose from anything from games to business, I really like it. It's cute, made nice...I did purchase the iPearl mCover Hard Shell Case http://www.amazon.com/iPearl-mCover and it fit's wonderfully and protects it at the same time. You can save pics..etc. instead of right clicking and saving you will click your tab at the right hand side top of your google chrome page and scroll down where it say's save page as and it's simple as that. Takes some getting used to but all in all I love it and it's faster then the speed of light. You can actually turn off your laptop by just closing the lid of the laptop, simple as that. I say go for it and I love it!!!

14,"The first one had a screen malfunction within two months. Half the screen just went dark (extreme pixel problems). Although it was out of the 30 day return period, Amazon (after some gentle persuasion) decided to send me a replacement and not make me go through Samsung warranty services (which would have been a drawn out nightmare).So far, the replacement has had no issues, screen or otherwise.I bought this unit because I thought it would be a good compromise between a tablet and fully functioning traditional laptop. And, for the price, it's a great value!I wanted a lightweight, quick-booting machine with a full keyboard that had good battery life. That is exactly what I got. My wife uses it mainly for web browsing and media consumption and occasionally uses Google docs to work with a document or spreadsheet, etc.Yes, there are things it can't do that a traditional laptop can. Yes, it takes a while to get used to what the Chrome OS can and can't do. Yes, there's no Skype app so you have to use Google Hangouts. Yes, you can't hook a printer up to it but have to use Google Cloudprint (you have to be signed in to the corresponding account, frustrating when you are browsing anonymously and want to print, or logged in to a different user that isn't associated with the cloudprint printer). No, it doesn't have a touchscreen, so if that's an issue, buy a tablet. But again, I wanted something in between the two form factors, and this seems to be a good fit.And for the money, it's almost a throw away machine, in a sense. I mean, what do you expect for a couple hundred dollars? I am happy with what it has to offer.

15,"The pros are that the keyboard, as mentioned in other reviews, is super easy to type on, nice and big and easy to use, unlike my Acer netbook which was almost impossible to type on.Obviously the price is a huge pro and the the free apps available such as picture editing and word processing are fantastic.The battery life is also excellent and it seems to charge within an hour and will last about 8 hours after that off the charger.The touch pad is awesome, too.  This very much reminds me of my sisters MacBook Pro, it has features that aren't on a traditional windows based laptop (at least not the 2 cheap ones I've had previously) and I appreciate this because it makes browsing online and scrolling up and down pages much easier and faster.The only con is that this really truly is strictly web based.  That means NO programs are on your desktop. That means NO iTunes!  There is a way around that using Google Play and there are very helpful Youtube videos to help figure out ways to get what you want even though you can't download programs.Overall this is an excellent value. I bought mine for school work online and I believe this is an excellent tool for that. Definitely recommend it for computer savvy folks who aren't obsessed with having it all.

16,"I've had this laptop for over a year now and I'm quite satisfied with it. It's a great laptop for a college student like me. There are some drawbacks to it though. First, if you have too many taps open it tends to freeze on you. Second, if you have Google's version of powerpoint and Pandora active simultaneously the laptop will lack, so it's better to just leave Pandora off while using Google's powerpoint. Just use your phone and download the Pandora app. Now, don't let these things discourage you from buying it because it has never stop me from not being able to accomplish my assignments. Let me go back to the statement I made about opening too many tabs. This only happens if you around the teen numbers of tabs open. If you mainly stick to your University's database when doing research you won't encounter this problem. Mainly because those webpages are just simple text and don't have fancy graphics going on in the background. Now if these things are going to discourage you from buying this laptop and you can spare an extra $100 or $200 then do so on a better chromebook. Would I get another chromebook? Yes, I would, but this time I would spare an extra $100 or $200 bucks. I was skeptical about chromebook which is why I bought the cheapest one. I'm definitely going to get another one because this one has seen some abuse from being carried around in my bookcase.

17,"I bought a Samsung Chromebook from Amazon in November of 2012.  It worked well and I was pleased with it.  The machine did  not get a lot of use because I do not travel very much; my principal computer is a Mac desktop.  Right after the warranty expired, the computer would not boot up.  All I got was a blue screen.  I googled this issue and learned that you are supposed to ""reset"" the machine by turning it off, sticking a paper clip into the pinhole on the bottom of the machine, and turning it on again.  After several tries, this worked and the machine came back to life. Not long after, it died again, and I tried dozens of times to ""reset"" it using the paperclip trick.  I contacted Samsung support and they had nothing to offer except the paperclip treatment.  They referred me to a 3rd party repair business at [...]  I went onto the site, created an account, and entered my Samsung Chrome Book serial number. A screen came up with a list of issues, and I clicked on ""won't boot up"".  The website told me I'd have to send in the machine for a ""free"" evaluation which costs $18.  There was no indication about the cost of repair, and the website said the most likely cause was a broken hard drive.  Which of course is nonsense because the Chromebook doesn't have a hard drive.  Not wanting to spend hundreds of dollars on repairs of a $250 machine, I think I'm just going to trash it.UPDATE:  I found a place on the Samsung website where you could write to the President's office.  I sent in my tale of woe, as described above, and they agreed to fix the machine free of charge.  I only had to pay to send it to Texas which was under $12 via UPS.  After 10 days it is back and it's working just fine.  It was only a couple of months beyond the warranty period so evidently they gave me a break for which I'm grateful.  Let's hope the repair lasts!!  (evidently it was a software problem...no physical damage to the machine happened). The squeaky wheel gets the grease!

18,"A review for the mature crowd, on using the Chromebook as your go to computer.  It actually is a 5 star but I gave it 4 because the size leaves just a little on the ""wanting/needs"" list.I've been using computers since 1979 and now at 72 I’m using a Samsung 11.3” Chromebook and the whole Google Chrome OS experience.  At 250 bucks it’s a great deal for what it does because it does it flawlessly, with minor exceptions.  The Chromebook size is almost perfect as a convenient door into the internet.  At about the size of a pad of paper it has all you need.  All the positive marketing points of the machine and Google Chrome OS system are true. For the majority of the population it fills our needs and is as simple as it gets.  If you use MS Internet Explorer the first thing you will notice is Google Chrome has eliminated every annoying attribute MS-IE ever invented.  Be honest with yourself and think about what you really do on your personal home computer.  If you feel the need for a Microsoft OS along with all the annoying security and daily updates in addition to the same for MS Office on a 1500 buck desktop maybe you should consider incorporating your family and hiring an IT guy too.  Personally I feel Google is the future of internet computing for the world.As to the negative aspects of using the Chromebook as my “go to” computer.  After three weeks of using the Samsung 11.3"" Chromebook the screen is still difficult to see and hard on my eyes.  Adjustments have been made for larger fonts and color changes have been made on some reading materials.  Could be because this reviewer wears bifocal eye glasses but it’s more than that.  There just isn’t much real estate to move things around especially when it comes to photos.  The clarity of the screen just doesn't pop out at you as would be the case in the Chromebook Pixel (I’m assuming).  However more to the point is the color or contrast on some web pages.  An example is Google Calendar,  the type just doesn't have good contrast.. One major problem on some web pages is the page does not fit on the screen.  I’m not a web designer so  I’m not sure where the problem is, the web, the Chromebook or Google. An example: I was on the Delta Airline reservations site and I could not use it to make my reservations because some of the page was overlaid and jumbled.  Same problems happened on many other sites where you have selection options in ordering things.Again, for the 250 bucks delivered into your house it is a steal.  It is really the perfect “recliner” companion for wireless surfing the web and general research/entertainment needs. Plus Google has so many “apps” you could spend the rest of your life just setting those up for “whatever”.

19,"I purchased my chromebook in early September, with the intention of using it for school. It still works the same as 6 months ago, but there were issues even then.Pros-Turns on/updates quickly-Programs open fast-Simple UI-Relatively cheap-Free 3G (sort of)Cons-Takes forever to load webpages. I have a desktop PC as well, and even when on the exact same connection my chromebook can take 5-10 seconds longer to load webpages. This causes a huge loss in working speed because it can take minutes for Google Drive to open and for me to actually reach the folder where my documents are contained.-Input is not processed most of the time. I believe this has to do with the fact that webpages are still loading, but even multiple minutes after the page loads my inputs might not register on the page simply because the chromebook's processor is too tied up.-Very low power. I understand that this is a very cheap laptop made to be affordable and fast on the internet, but I mainly play flash games, watch YouTube, go on Google Drive, or browse webpages. I've already stated how loading webpages and horrible response time makes it hard to do any of these, but the horrible processing power makes it worse. Want to watch a YouTube video at 30 frames per second? Nope, here's a video in 360p at 18 frames per second. Want to play a flash game at all? Nope, here's a flash game running at 30 frames per second, then freezes for ten seconds every couple seconds.-The free 3G is definitely not enough. Just navigating to this review page on amazon would likely cause me to go near my cap of 100 MB per month, that is if I'm not paying verizon a hefty sum for a plan I usually don't use. The only times I do use my 3G are the times which I need more than just 100MB. I usually just turn on my Smartphone's hotspot with an app called FoxFi in order to use more WiFi (4 GB plan on there)-The back panel where the charger, UCB ports and HDMI are located is not very sturdy. It began to fall off quickly once I got it, making it hard to insert USB.Summary-This is not a costly system by any means when compared to other laptops, and is fast on most things but the main selling point: internet speed. Slow loading times, input lag and slow processor speed make using this laptop a pain. The free 3G is nice but 100MB for free a month is not nearly enough. If I'm in the market for a new laptop, a chromebook would not be close to my first choice.

20,"I've had this Chromebook for almost 3 years. I must say that at this point in time, I would go with one of the newer model Chromebooks. Still, this Chromebook has held up incredibly well. Many new Chromebooks are still released with 2gb of ram and the same screen resolution as this Chromebook. The battery life in this one is not as impressive as some of the other models either, but I hit 5 or more hours regularly with it.It is a little slow. Some heavy sites like Drive, and Gizmodo can bog the thing down. Multitasking is also kind of hit or miss. But, for the time it was released it was great, and is still holding up well today. It still gets regular Chrome OS updates. It seems just as snappy as the day I bought it.The one thing that can really bog this Chromebook down is extensions. I would recommend only having 2 or 3 extensions enabled at a time. If you are unsure if extensions are affecting your performance, just log out and log into guest mode and see if pages load faster. I was surprised by how much extensions can affect performance.This laptop can be found relatively cheap secondhand, and would make a decent gift as a travel companion or a simple first computer. You don't have to worry about viruses, and it is extremely lightweight. I think The 11.6 inch size is perfect for portability. It's got a great sized keyboard, fits comfortably on the lap, and the screen is large enough to see things clearly. If you dip down into the 10 inch range, keyboards become cramped and those laptops are hard to actually fit on your lap unless you squeeze your legs together tightly.

22,"I've owned this little guy for about a month now, and have to say I'm quite impressed.  After shopping around a bit, I found that this was by far the best deal  - I was taking a class and needed something portable that could browse the internet and upload photos, and I didn't want to spend a buttload.  That was all.  So I went ahead and bought this Chromebook and started by giving it the true test of strength by taking it on a plane.First, it's sturdy.  Quite sturdy.  Not only does the construction feel solid when you hold it, but it held up to a few TSA manhandling sessions as I trekked across the country with it.  The front did get a bit scruffed up, but it's only minor surface damage, and that's what I get for not having a case and having everything grinding against everything else in my bag.  I carried this thing in my messenger bag during the mile long walk to and from class daily, and all was well.Second, it boots in something like five seconds.  Then you log in.  And there's no waiting.  No slow parsing of the various background programs, no loading, nothing - you're in.  I generally use Linux at home, and this is the fastest load I've ever seen.  Also, all of your Google everything is synched - e-mail, drive, blogger, etc., even bookmarks if you're a Chrome user by default.  So you already have everything at your fingertips right after booting this little guy for the first time.Third, I was taking photos in class everyday, and while there is no app for processing RAW/NEF photos (yet) the default image editor was fine when I shot in JPEG.  Sure, it's no Photoshop, but for quick and simple adjustments it worked just fine.  Not like I needed level editing or anything crazy.  And the display is high quality enough to easily and clearly view my photos in all of their glory.  I would upload everything to Drive afterwards and call it a day, and would only briefly store a few images here and there  on the hard drive when I needed to (the hard drive is little.  It's not meat for a lot of storage, which was fine by me).  So far so good, and no problems at all.Now, here's where I have to knock a star.  Google, as it turns out, does not support Java, as they're heading in the direction of HTML 5.  This is fine, but as it turned out there was a site for class that I needed to access that required a Java based application.  In order to access it, I had to - and I can't stress this enough DO NOT DO THIS.  UNLESS YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.  DON'T DO IT.  NOT WORTH IT YOU CAN BREAK EVERYHING - set my Chromebook into dev mode (DON'T DO THIS) in order to get Java working.  I did, and all was good. However, in dev mode, each time you boot you are asked whether you want to return to normal mode.  In a stupid haze, I accidentally hit yes, not realizing that to do this you need a pre made recovery disk (which I highly recommend making as soon as you get this, just to have on hand) to fully recover the machine.  There were some words said, they were not nice, but thankfully my friend allowed me to use his machine to make a disc and get everything back to normal.Now, HTML 5 is all fine and dandy, but there are some things that still use Java that would be really nice to have access to in normal mode, and since I know this little beast of a netbook can run Java, I'm a bit miffed that it's not included in the default setup.  So sorry Chromebook, you almost get 5 stars - 4.5, really.In short, buy this.  If you're going to be surfing the web and maybe doing a bit of word processing, get this.  Save your money and get something that works well, is fast, eerily quiet, and has 9 hours of battery life.  Don't waste your money on an expensive machine unless you're doing something that really needs it, and surfing the internet does not count.  This does that wonderfully.

23,"Although my experience with the Chromebook was initially somewhat of a disappointment, I am a converted Chromebook fan!When I first received the Chromebook as a gift, after the first minutes of use I was extremely frustrated. The unit kept restarting randomly, freezing and crashing for no apparent reason. I troubleshooted the issue and attempted to repair it following the advice of Google Forums, reliable tech web articles and Samsung Support, but none of this resolved the issue. The issues were so severe and frustrating that I considered returning it and not ever buying a Google/Samsung product ever again.My girlfriend recommended returning it for an exchange unit and I followed her advice (thankfully!). When I received the new Chromebook, it performed like a champ! Assuming that the first faulty unit I received was an exception, the Samsung Chromebook is an amazing product!Structurally, the unit is solid, very lightweight and even though it's made of plastic, it looks and feels sleek. The screen is bright and the image detail is great. The keyboard is a delight, the keys are firm and springy and seem to take abuse and fast typing. The trackpad is responsive and the gesture controls are cool.Performance-wise, the unit is amazing! It boots up in seconds (around 8) and the apps/browser runs smooth. There are some noticeable delays in screen renderings when scrolling, some skips on videos when changing tabs and some minor lagging when more apps or tabs are running. You have to remember, this is a $250 unit, so it won't run like a supercomputer. You cannot expect immediate tab switching or super smooth multitasking, but for an obsessive and highly critical guy, the unit works magnificently.Regarding the Google-ish aspects of the computer, this will force you to use Google Docs, Drive and the other Google Apps and this is totally a good thing! This will actually make you use more Google products, so you'll end up discovering new and amazing apps with tons of features.If you have a decent working Windows PC or laptop and are bored/sick of using it, this will be a super smart buy. You can use the Chromebook for everything, and if you ever encounter something that the Chromebook cannot handle, just turn to your old PC/laptop, simple as that! I am using the unit on a daily basis for almost a month now and have only turned to my Windows laptop  twice, and it was for things that I really did not need or could have worked around using my Android phone.You will not regret buying this piece of machinery!

24,"I have a Nexus 7 and a 15 inch laptop. The Nexus is very good.. I wanted a bigger screen. The laptop is wonderful .. I wanted a lighter one.The Chromebook fits perfectly. It has a nice keyboard, starts in 1-2 seconds, can have multiple user logins, can have an external disk via USB, has HDMI port, is light.. and is like a bigger tablet with a keyboard.Some say the Android store is bigger than a chrome store. Agreed. But one would need like maybe 20 or 50 apps.. not the 1 billion or 1 trillion apps that we get on a mobile app store. Chrome store had all apps I needed.Look out for versions of chromebooks. Check out Google Play store before going for a brand of Chromebook.Update 10/15*************I have now had this for over 6 months. I had to return to Samsung, after its motherboard crashed for no reason. Since it was under warranty, Samsung replaced it. In July, it stopped all of a sudden, and wont power up. They took about 20 days to replace the internals. Now I see another problem - it freezes for a minute every now and then, and reboots on its own.In my opinion, this is more a Samsung hardware issue. Hope the HP Chromebooks are better.I did love the fact that this Chromebook was like a 10inch tablet with a keyboard and mousepad. Love Chrome OS, like the overall Samsung Chromebook.. hate it when it freezes on me.BTW - I take great care of my chromebook, so no reason why it should go bad.(Reduced the rating from 5 to 3 stars. A few more freezes, and I will call Samsung again - what else can we expect ?)Update 10/28------------I am now completely fed up with the crashes. Every other minute, the screen freezes, and the system reboots. Hope it does not reboot before I complete this sentence. I am completely disappointed with Samsung items. THe past 3 years I have recommended everyone to get a Galaxy S or a Note or a Samsung Chromebook. No more. This Samsung Chromebook is was great were it not rebooting every other minute. It is like you have received a free new car, and you take it on a ride, and it shuts down every 3 miles. One day I will drive my car on top of this Samsung Chromebook... I am done with all products Samsung.

25,"Overall I love this computer.  The person who sold it to me was wonderful (some issues with delivery that he was very helpful with). The computer itself is lightweight, fairly indestructable given the plasticness of it all.  My big complaint about chrome is the assumption that one will always have access to the internet.  There is minimal room for storage of data on the computer, and I've had trouble manipulating data that I have stored on a travel drive. I live in a part of the country that has spotty internet (Maine), and frequently find myself without access to anything that I need.  Would love to be able to download and work on documents. I'm not great at hacking solutions, so need a computer that gives them to me easily, and this is not that computer.  It also does not adapt well to standard programs such as word.  Chrome is its own universe.  I'm not a computer nerd, so probably should have picked up a computer that was a bit more adaptable.  Having said that, it does most of what I need it to do, it was incredibly inexpensive, and the manufacturer was up front about the limitations (which google would not see as limitations).  And, I'm writing this 3 years after buying the computer, with no signs of computer death on the horizon.

26,"I just got the Samsung Chromebook 3 3G and I'm pretty happy with it so far - less than 24 hours.  I purged Microsoft Windows from my work and house about a year ago and have loved it since.  I'm quite technical but I found myself spending way too much time maintaining my Windows computers - anti-virus, anti-malware, getting corporate grade firewalls, patching, de-fragging, etc.  I had a almost brand new Dell Optiplex and it was slowing to a crawl after less than 1 year with all the normal gumming up with the above updates.The worst of the matter is that I still had issues and would have to regularly re-image in order to restore the performance and security of the machines.  I estimate that I spent several days a year with all the maintenance.  So I got a Mac Mini swapped with the Optiplex and a MacBook Pro for work.  I haven't spent any time maintaining them at all.  I tried the disk utility to see if there were any disk issues and even that is unnecessary.  I love having those days back.  OS X is not that much of a change from Windows but the added security and lack of maintenance required is just awesome.The only bad part are that Mac's are overpriced for the hardware you get.  I got a refurb Mac Mini from Apple and it was much cheaper b/c I reused my Optiplex's setup with 25"" monitor.  A similar Mac setup would have cost 2x or 3x as much.  The MBP and Mac Pro desktop were provided by my work.  The one missing piece was a laptop for personal use.I love Google sponsored hardware.  I have a Nexus 4 and Nexus 7.  I love how up to date they are seamlessly.  However, using a Nexus 7 with a bluetooth keyboard just doesn't cut it as a laptop replacement.  I don't like the awful, chicklet keyboards.  So my requirements were a super light, non-Windows, laptop with great keyboard ....and cheap <$500.  Incidentally, Apple laptops are not that light b/c they are all aluminum.  My 13"" MBP is not something that I want to take to work or on trips at 4.5 lbs.The Samsung Chromebook 3 was perfect - it is light (2lbs less than MBP), with a great keyboard, not Windows (no maintenance, no security issues), and it was only $330 w/built-in 3G connectivity (no external hotspots, dongles, etc.).  It's 1/3 the cost of the entry level Macbook Air.So it's not perfect, out of the box, one of the screen hinges was misaligned.  I was able to correct it myself but it spoke to the quality control in a $300 laptop.  The worst experience was I couldn't connect to WiFi - for a simple laptop, this was a bit unacceptable.  There is a simple 3 question connection setup and it didn't work.  You figure that phones and tablets could easily connect to a WiFi why wouldn't a laptop whose primary method to operate is through WiFi seamlessly connect?  The Chromebook had an advanced setup that only a rocket scientist would be able to figure out to set correctly.So I turned to the Internet.  In the end, through forums that I read, I did two things.  Set the wireless router to a fixed channel (removed the automatic configuration) and restarted the router.  These two things solved the problem with connection, why?  No idea.  Setup afterwards was very easy.Since then, I have loved the Chromebook.  It is super super light.  The keyboard is great.  The build quality is a bit suspect but not bad for a sub $300 computer (e.g. misaligned hinge, creaks in corners, etc.)  Chrome has autoupdated itself quickly and even better than either Nexus I have.  It is a bit slow in the performance dept. - slightly choppy video at 720p.  Overally, I am very pleased with the value of the Chromebook.The best part is Google will be constantly adding major new features periodically, just like my Nexus 4 and Nexus 7.  I don't have to put up with the hassles of Microsoft or the premium cost of Apple which is outrageous.

27,"I bought this product on Oct. 13, 2017 for $75 knowing that it is a refurbished 2012 chromebook. I took a risk and it paid off. Before purchasing this device I did some research and knew what to expect of it. I plan on using this mostly to write term papers and do some basic web browsing and streaming.- Appearance wise, it is obvious that the product has been used before and is not brand new. As seen in the pictures that I attached, there are scratches (which I personally would not describe as ""minor"" like the seller did) on the outer part of the chromebook. Hence, the one star I took off. The screen, the keyboard. and the track pad of the chrome book are not scratched.- Keyboard is not back lit but has a very good feel to it. Search button can be remapped into caps lock since there isn't a caps lock button, just in case that matters to you guys as much as it does to me haha. I love the feel of the keyboard!- System wise, the device is still up to par. Very fast boot up and it loads webpages very quickly (not sure if its just my internet connection or the device but it is pretty darn quick). It stutters a bit when i have 7-8 tabs open but not so much that I would consider it a big deal.- Battery is fantastic. A full battery lasted 7 hours of mainly browsing, writing papers, and some video playing. I did not have any problems streaming from Netflix and Amazon video.- Sound from the device is nothing special. It gets muffled sometimes when I use the device on my lap as the speakers are on the underside of the device. I haven't used the device offline as much. I'll update my review when I have.The chromebook is great for Chrome remote desktop! I have a windows 10 laptop and can easily access it through the chromebook.In conclusion, I love the chrome book. I like the Chrome operating system and I think that it is a fit for my basic needs. The scratches on the outside can be easily covered by a case. I haven't used the device offline as much. I'll update my review when I have. I'm just hoping that the device will prove to be durable. For the $75 that I paid, this chromebook is definitely worth it.

28,"I received my Chrome book today and have spent the last few hours playing around with this.  All I can say, as my review title mentioned, what am I missing here?  So much of the what so many reviewers have said previously is absolutely true.  If you know what you're getting into purchasing this device you will be very very satisfied with it, as am I.  The screen is absolutely adequate for what you need.  From the moment I fired it up I haven't once thought to myself that I wish it were brighter or clearer.  The philosophical approach to this laptop is fantastic.  I have loaded all my itunes music into google play, copied all my dropbox files to my google drive (which by the way is in fact 100 gb now!), and my gmail is of course already stored online.  This device enables me to be self contained and able to work from this device for the majority of reasons I ever needed a desktop computer.  Sure there may be occasions when I need to use the new MS office suite (2013) I just purchased but for 95% of my document needs googe docs/drive will work just fine.  The entire cloud approach is very nicely represented by this chrome book and it does EXACTLY what it was designed to do.  I am very satisfied and will likely log on again in a few weeks/months and  provide a follow-up review.  For now, I am sitting here playing my music on Google play, just finished editing a MS word document I had stored and edited on Google drive, and have also checked, and responded to some email.  All for $249.  Seriously, cool stuff.**Update - July 9, 2013Couldn't be happier with this purchase.  Have now owned this Chromebook for five months and have had ZERO issues with it.  The battery life is excellent and, since purchasing it, have probably used my home computer half a dozen times.  It is small, light, reliable, and a breeze to use.  Given that my wife and oldest son have Google accounts, they too log onto this and use it all the time.  The Chromebook does a great job of keeping all three accounts separate and secure.  When I log onto the system I feel like I am the only owner and that is a great thing!  Between my Galaxy S III and this laptop, Google has me completely sold.  It is WAY too expensive to go all in with Apple and this Chromebook has brought it all together for me.  Oh, and one other thing, our ipad has turned into a glorified movie player for our kids.  The Chromebook is SO much more efficient at doing the things I used to try to use my ipad for.  The keyboard this Chromebook has is excellent and after five hard months of use hasn't hiccuped once.

29,"I resisted the whole Google Docs stripped down cloud based computer thing because I believed the word-processing program was not sophisticated enough to meet my needs. As an academic, I write documents that are footnote heavy, and I thought I needed all the feature of the bloated and inelegant Microsoft Office Suite.  I was wrong. Google Docs has all of the important features I need to produce academic papers, and I can deploy most of them more easily and efficiently than they deploy on Word.  It is perfectly compatible with Word, and moving a document back and forth between Word on my office computer and Google Docs on my chromebook--making changes and additions each time--was seamless and created no issues.  This Samsung chromebook is as portable as an iPad, but  much better for writing than tablets, which are primarily consumption, not production devices.  The easy sync via Google Drive, (100 gigs storage for two years free) make me regret that I recently paid for a year of Dropbox in advance. And while Dropbox does a few things better than Google Drive, Google Drive does a few things better than Dropbox as well.  I am likely to go out and buy a Chrome box for my home office next.  My employer is still invested in maintaining the old clunky MS Office Suite on my work desktop, and there are a (very) few formatting features that Word has that are missing in Google Docs. I can easily convert a final draft of my work to Word for making final formatting changes and for sending off to journals and publishers (who generally require Word Docs). But I see little reason to struggle with MS Office Products on a daily basis.

31,"The Samsung Chromebook is a perfect computer for people who simply like to live on the Internet.  This is not the computer for people who need to run Windows programs -- it will not run programs made for Windows.  Anyone wanting to move from a Windows or Mac computer to a Chromebook must adopt a new way of thinking about the tasks they want to accomplish.  Instead of Microsoft Office, you have Google Docs, etc...Personally, I have enabled developer mode so I can get at the Linux internals (running a chrooted Arch Linux environment, etc).  This machine has completely replaced my previous laptop.  I have ssh, vim, and a web browser, exactly what I need.The battery life is phenomenal, over 6 hours.  The keyboard is a pleasure to type on, comparable to my Wife's MacBook Air (minus the backlight, of course).  The screen, while only 1366x768, is actually pretty decent at this size.  That said, I definitely notice the lower resolution when I switch from my Nexus 10.  I do prefer the matte finish on the Chromebook though, as the glossy screens are completely unusable if you have any light sources behind you.Are you someone who just wants to use the Internet from a cheap, lightweight laptop?  Get this Chromebook.  Are you a hacker or tinkerer who likes playing with Linux?  Get this Chromebook.  Are you an average computer user who likes to edit photos, home movies, play games, etc?  This is probably not the computer for you.

32,"I was recently thinking about replacing my trusty old MacBook with something a bit lighter. The MacBook has been a workhorse, but at six pounds, I find myself leaving it at home if I'm going any further than the local coffee shop. I toyed with the idea of getting a MacBook Air, which seems like the perfect laptop for me, but coming off a long stretch of unemployment, the price was too steep for my meager budget. Then the Samsung Chromebook came out.I do all my writing in Google Docs, so the Chromebook seemed like it might be the perfect laptop for my needs. It is light (2.31 pounds), it has a good keyboard, and it is specifically designed to work well with Google stuff. Best of all, it was only $249--about a third of the price of a MacBook Air. What could possibly go wrong?Not much, as it turns out. After using the laptop for a few weeks now, I can report that it lives up to its billing. For anyone who has replaced their Microsoft Office with Google's Docs, the Chromebook it certainly worth considering. That's not to say it is perfect. There are some problems with the Chromebook. Some of these problems are minor, but some are not. I'll get to the problems in a minute, but first, here's a quick rundown of the computers fine points.Unlike almost every laptop on the planet, the Chromebook runs neither Windows nor OSX. It has its own operating system, which is entirely based around Google's Chrome browser. Any documents you create are saved in the Google Drive window. Sometimes this can be  a little disorienting. If you go to change the Settings on the computer, for instance, it opens as a window in Chrome.You have option of installing additional programs, but only those that are available through the Chrome store. In this respect, it's a bit like an iPad, but with real keyboard. Fortunately, the Chrome Store is very robust at this point. I needed a flowchart program, for instance, and I was able to find one that fit my needs perfectly (Lucidcharts) without any difficulty. However, if your business relies on a specific software package, the Chromebook might not suit your needs. The Chrome Store is worth checking though as many major cloud-based systems (such as Salesforce) offer Chrome apps.The keyboard is good on the Chromebook. It is a chiclet-style keyboard nearly identical to the one on the MacBook Air in appearance and feel. The one odd characteristic of the keyboard is the replacement of the Caps Lock key with a key that brings up the applications menu; a bit like the Windows key on a PC. Fortunately, you can easily switch this key back to a Caps Lock function in the Settings menu. I suspect that most people will want to do this right away.The computer does not include many ports, but the ones it has are good ones. They include an HDMI port for hooking the computer up to a high-def TV, a USB 2 and a USB 3 port. It has an SD card slot that will accept SD, SDHC and SDXC cards, and it has a USIM slot, which, if I can figure out how to use it (and it isn't too expensive to use), might be useful for using the Chromebook at my favorite local coffee shop, which doesn't have WiFi.Of course, the biggest thing the computer has going for it is its weight. At less than two-and-a-half pounds, I found myself checking my briefcase after leaving the house to make sure I had remembered to bring it. After four years of lugging around my old MacBook it was a nice change.One of the features that helped me decide to purchase the Chromebook was the inclusion of multiple finger gestures. Like the MacBook, you can scroll down by dragging down the trackpad with two fingers. Tap to click is available for those of you who like this feature, although personally, it's the first thing I turn off. Like the PC, it offers a right and left click, which is one of the few things I have always preferred about PCs. Since there are no right and left buttons on the Chromebook, the right click is accessed by clicking with two fingers.Of course, it's not all goodness and light. There are some things you should consider before buying the Chromebook. People who rely on the Macbook's lighted keyboard are going to be disappointed to find that this feature is missing. It also requires you to have a Google account and work, at least part of the time, on line. The computer has a sync feature that lets you continue working when you are not online, but it is really intended as more of a stopgap than an alternative. The system prefers to be connected.When it is shipped, there is a styrofoam sheet that separates the keyboard from the screen. You might want to save this sheet. After carrying the laptop around for a few days, I noticed a gray smudge on the screen where it came in contact with the bottom of the keyboard. This wiped off easily, still, you might want to use that styrofoam sheet to skip this necessity.If you are using multiple tabs in Chrome, the system essentially turns off the tabs that you are not using. This means there is sometimes a slight lag as the page is redisplayed when you click from tab to tab. How much of a lag seems to depend more on your wireless connection than on the computer.The biggest drawback for the Chromebook is its inability to handle special characters easily. By special characters, I don't simply mean things like vowels with accent marks (é, ê, ü, ä, ö), but even the everyday em dash--like the one I just used. Here is one area where the Mac has outshone all other operating systems since the beginning. You want to type an em dash? Hold down the Option and shift keys and press the hyphen key. Voila! you have an em dash. To do the same thing on a PC requires a little more work. You have to hold down the alt key and press 0151 on the numeric keypad (it won't work on the number keys). That's a bit more work, and it's a real pain in the ass on a PC laptop, where to access the numeric keypad, you have to press a function key to turn part of your keyboard into a keypad temporarily.But that is nothing compared to the Chromebook where to enter an em dash, you have hold down Control and Shift Keys and press U, then type 2014, and then hit enter. Essentially seven key gestures for one character. To make matters worse, this command sequence doesn't work in the actual Google documents. there are ways around this, but none of them are very good. You can choose special characters from the insert menu, which is probably the easiest way, or you can assign certain key combinations to convert to other characters. You could, for instance, assign a double dash to turn into an em dash (Microsoft Word does this), but this will only work if the dashes are set off from the other words by a space. The same for other special characters, which makes this feature a lot less useful.In spite of these problems, the Chromebook is a nearly perfect laptop for a specific market segment. If you are someone who is working primarily (or better yet, exclusively) in Google Docs, this is the laptop for you. I recommend the Chromebook wholeheartedly. It is a great little machine at an astounding price.

You will need to create a gmail account, and from this account you have the ability to write, edit and store documents (even off line - when there is NO internet connections), upload and edit photos, email people and even for the advanced computer person - remotely access other machines. Once your account is created on this machine or elsewhere for a gmail account, you are already linked to these services. This machine is optimized to work with google's products and for considerable battery life.While many articles seem to debate the way Google is collecting information, for some surreptitious purpose, it is a Salem With Trial with a wacky jury.

34,"UpdateSo I commented on this in my original review but the screen is quite bad on this Chromebook. It has bad viewing angles I find it hard to fine one that works well. There is a part of me that wishes I shopped around and spent $100 on a Chromebook with a better screen (they would have other drawbacks of course). But I bought the Chromebook mainly for one task  and that was budget google docs which the Chromebook does well.I bought a chromebook because I did not want to spend $1000 on a new laptop and everything below that price always seemed like a rip off. They would have nice specs, but crappy screens, etc. I bought the chromebook because just about everything I do is in chrome and I have a desktop at both home and work if I need to do heavy typing.I do plan to use this to take heavy duty notes when I observe teachers (I am a high school admin.) but have not done so yet and will update this review when I do.ProsScreen has good viewing angles, much better than I expectedVery lightMassive battery lifeTurns on fastI have not found a website that the chrome book has had anymore issues loading the chrome does on a computer.Offline mode works great for google docsFriend of mine logged onto their office 365 account so that works too.ConsScreen is not the best, but no worse than any screen on a $400-500 laptopGoogle maps is a little slow to load, I hear this may have to do with a few new things it no longer does in the backgroundGoogle docs is great for typing documents, but if you need excel forget it.Overall this laptop feels like one worth twice as much. In fact if they sold one with a better screen, even at a higher cost, I do not think I would consider buying any other laptop again. But it is still worth 5 stars due to the $250. price

35,"First: A bit about myself- I am a Linux operating system user (as my main systems) and also use android for cellphone and broadband serivce. I use Google Chrome or open source version (Chromium browser) as my preferred browsers, and anyone familiar with them, knows that you have full access to mail, drive, pictures, and all google services, from within your browser, homepage.This Samsung Chromebook , I purchase as a test to see how useful , a laptop without dvd/cd rom could be.For online entertainment , all sites like Netfilx, Hulu, Amazon Prime instant video, all work great, with no noticable video lag , even in full screen.It has usb, 3.0 and 2.0 .. hook up a wireless mouse and  it is really nice . I fits right where one would normally set a regular keyboard on a computer desk.The keyboard is very nice size and much like at regular size keyboard. Touchpad size is also nice, when you choose to use it.This computer starts  up in under 20 seconds and shutdown in 10 or less, with the SSD.So far , I am impressed with it, but I am using it on Verizon Wireless mobile hotspot and the speed is sweet. I have had satellite internet service in the past and wouldn't recommend purchasing one of these, if you have a high latency internet service, as you will defiantly not like to ""wait"" on each item to load, in your google online account.Recommend , yes, if on cable , mobile hotspot with unlimited data (if you plan on watching lot of videos) or dsl , but not on satellite service.Defiantly yes, if you are just a ""live in the browser"" type of person, and already use Gmail, for your email service.No, if you wish to watch dvds...as it doesn't have drives.Overall.... I love it, it is like have a large version of a smartphone/tablet, with a keyboard.

36,"This is a great computer for web surfing/shopping and email. At first it sucked because Netflix didn't work on it, but now that support has been added for that it works well for watching movies. It works with Amazon Prime movies too. I love that it starts up almost instantly because of it's solid state drive and simple operating system. This is a great little computer when you don't need to use any office programs or access multiple email accounts. It's screen is brighter than the Macbook Air and resolution looks perceptively about the same. Very cool and very affordable. I haven't really tried any of the Apps yet. They look kind of lame so far, but maybe they will improve over time.We bought this at the same time as a Sony Tap 20 all in one Windows 8 desktop and I've had to refresh the operating system on that twice in 18 months due to it slowing down possibly due to malicious bugs picked up on the internet. So far no problems with this Chrome book. Supposedly it's less susceptible to viruses as these things are not targeted as much and it does not allow applications to be loaded. This seems to have been proven.I've have had it with Windows PCs and am migrating over all of our computer hardware to other brands now as just about all, if not all, the business, tax, photo, and video productivity software I need is available to run on a trouble free Mac. I'm just tired of wasting time that I could be spending with my family on a stupid computer that should just work like all the other expensive appliances around the house. Is that too much to ask for?

37,"First off - I knew what I was getting when I ordered this thing. I knew it wasn't an Alienware gaming laptop with the best processor, most RAM, and biggest HD. This is an app-driven, cloud-based operating system which is fast, sleek, and very well put together. That being said, here's my review.I got this fast as ever from Amazon (Thanks Prime). Unboxing wasn't spectacular, but hey, who cares really. It didn't start when I first picked it up, but when I plugged it in, it started right away, and the battery had about 75% charge. I thought it was weird it didn't start up immediately but no big deal.Battery Life: Amazing! This thing really does last 6.5 hours on a charge (a full charge is just over an hour) which is pretty spectacular for a laptop these days.Screen: It's slightly lackluster. The resolution is good, but it just doesn't have that 'pop' that most of the expensive laptops have these days. There's also an angle 'issue' that if you're not at the right viewing angle, it's a bit hard to see it, but hey, that's why it opens more...OS: I love the Chrome operating system, and I use the browser on my desktop. It's great having everything the same when you go to another computer. It's fast, responsive, and works well. I haven't had an issue yet.Keyboard: I really like it. I'm kind of picky about laptop keyboards so I don't like most, but this one feels good, although not top of the line. I'm a big guy with larger hands, but they fit nicely on the keyboard without any problems.Wifi: This works great, and was easy to connect.Webcam: This is probably the worst part of the product. With technology the way it is, there's no reason there can't be a webcam that doesn't lag and have bad lighting like this one does. I haven't used it much, but I don't see it as a great means of communication as it's not good quality and could be frustrating to another used trying to see me.Each purchase comes with a free 100GB of could storage from Amazon which is more than anyone should need. I don't have problems saving things to the cloud, as it's easy to do and keeps the computer itself from getting bogged down like older ones seem to do. There is a slight learning curve for this thing as it isn't Windows, but if you know your way around a computer this is not a problem.Overall I love this thing and I'm glad I finally got it. The plastic is a bit cheap feeling, but for under $300 after taxes and shipping it's well worth it! If you're looking for a piece of equipment for younger kids, students, or just for browsing the internet or working on documents, this is the best option out there!

38,"I got my 6 and 8 year old kids chromebooks to go to school websites to do homework. There are some sites that they can go to to plays games, also some Youtube stuff that the like and we supervise. Kids need to be computer literate and a Chromebook is a good choice primarily because it takes viruses and malware out of the equation. A Chromebook uses only Chome Apps like Gmail, Drive, Docs ,Google search, to access sites on the internet, everything remains server side, nothing is downloaded on your computer (No risk of viruses). You can do almost everything you want to do but it takes some educating yourself at first, buy a Chromebook instructional manual. For example, my son can't play Mindcraft on his Chromebook because Mindcraft is a software app that needs to be downloaded on your computer, a Chromebook only goes to sites on the internet and downloads nothing on your computer.

39,"Still have the chromebook right now after over a year of use. It is a really great laptop for the price. The SSD is blazing fast. Google Drive and Google Apps work extremely well. I don't miss Microsoft Office at all. Still very good for taking notes in class, even when offline. Also, the battery lasts me at least 6-9 hours with regular use.It does have some downsides though. For example, 16gb of memory is pretty restricting, I carry around a large flash drive to make up for it, however you get 100gb of google drive storage with it, which definitely helps a ton. Also, it feels cheap and flimsy. You could tell that you're holding a $200 laptop. The plastic scratches easily, and small pieces of it have chipped off. Don't let this fool you though, it is still very durable as a whole. I throw it in my backpack under textbooks and stuff and it never gets crushed or breaks.

It doesn't really bother me either.I do wonder how longer the charger will last. The charger plugin on the back is about the size of an old calculator charger (very small).Not having to worry about viruses or malware is nice.

Gets stuck when I don't know what I am doing, occasionally, but just turn it off, back on and 'Voila', a few seconds interruption instead of fifteen minutes.  The first time I got an update, I held my breath and I kid you not, by the time I had to breath again, the update was finished.  I am still getting used to Google+, Gmail and google docs, but most of the time it has simpler ways to do things and I am so used to the old fashioned way that I am making it harder.  I have found more than one choice(s) for every app I needed and I am avoiding apps that download to the machine (as much as possible).  I limited myself to one game, for example, lol.  It is heavier than I thought it would be, but lots lighter than my HP notebook/Apple Macbook.  I am going to get rid of both of them as soon as I convert my databases.  I was going to share it with my family, but not now.  Just like the commercial, I'm gonna be most attached.  Booting up takes seconds and shutdown about the same.  Battery power is good.  I did get a Targis Coolpad (out of closet) to keep the heat off my lap.  It is much cooler than other devices, but still after 2 hours, it gets warm.  I also bought a Merkury PINK and PURPLE cover sack with pockets so I can keep my headphones, flash drive and microphone handy.  Also, I use the headset to listen most of the time, because the speakers are on the bottom of the device.  I thought that was dumb, but my friend pointed out that if you put it on a hard surface, like a table, it vibrates against the table and sounds much better.  Who knew? Ahh, I'd prefer the USB connect on side or front, but not really that much trouble.  Does tend to stick out and makes it awkward on my lap-desk.  Overall, I have recommended to my friends, but there are lots of choices and migrating your stuff and some programs are not quite ready for cloudy days ahead, lol.

If you mostly browse the internet and watch movies then this is the computer for you.  Its light with a great battery and an amazing keyboard.  The build quality could be slightly better but I think if treated right this computer should stand the test of time.  As I'm writing this I have about ten tabs open, while playing pandora and I've yet to experience any lag.  The OS is easy enough to use it only took me a couple of minutes to get the gist of everything.  It makes me wish I had never bought my tablet, I highly recommend this product.UPDATE July 23rd 2013So I've had this beast for awhile now and I'm still loving it.  Google has made a couple of updates that I'm not super pumped about like being forced to use HTML5 for youtube besides that though this computer is still amazing! It used to lag while using the HDMI to connect to the TV but google seems to have fixed that.  I haven't noticed any decline in the battery and keyboard is still fantastic.  My only real gripe is how easy this computer gets scratched, I'm a student and I swear the edge of my books will scratch this computer.  It makes my once mildly sexy Chromebook look a tad ghetto but I guess it's $250.  I'll continue to update as time rolls on and report if anything significant happens.  Hands down my favorite laptop I've ever used.UPDATE: October 21st 2013Still an awesome computer that works great with amazing battery life. I really dont have a single complaint to make yet.

44,"There are many reviews about the strengths and limitations of this computer but most of them have to do with the wi-fi computer and they don't specifically address the 3G version. I love the 3G concept because I am all over the place and I do not always have wi-fi at work. When I first had it I did not connect to the 3G right away as it was a little time consuming and the offline worked fine for Google docs, calendar and the other apps that I was using to document my work tasks.  Then I finally did connect to the 3G and this is a great deal too as Verizon provides a free 3G plan so anywhere there is 3G and no wi-fi you have internet (like a phone with 3G for example).  This computer is just for work for me so I don't need a lot of 3G time.  So then it took me a long time to figure out that one month I was out of time on the 3G plan and the computer does not know When the 3G plan is out of time and does not tell the user this and so it tries to work on-line and can't and simply freezes or if it does pull up Google docs or other apps (because Google apps are browser based they have trouble working off-line-see other reviews) it does not work right. It became very frustrating because it does not tell you that you need to add more time or at least to disable the 3G to use it offline.  Just disable the 3G or purchase more time and it works fine again. Go to the 3G plan and disable it and the computer will work off line. Then you will have more time from your Verizon plan the next month.  If you don't remember the date you added the 3G plan then you have to call Verizon. You can purchase plans from Verizon and I will add 3G time once the 12 month free time is over, because it is worth it.  Good luck.

Powered by the Google-verse: this kinda makes or breaks your experience with it. My family is fully onboard with Google products and the online world, so this purchase was a no-brainer when a new computer was needed this last winter. The wife absolutely loves it and uses it far more than myself at home; if passing the wife-test is important for your gadgets, this one should pass with flying colors. The keyboard and trackpad are excellent and by far the best I've used on a laptop; it's pretty amazing how well they put this little guy together that blows away a far more expensive (and bloated software-loaded) Dell machine by comparison.The only reservation I had with it before purchase was the screen size. I was able to try it out on one at work and show it to the wife; once you get used to it, the smaller screen really isn't a problem. Chrome OS was almost designed for a small screen and while I would still prefer a larger one, that can wait for the next Chromebook purchase (assuming they keep these machines so affordable; part of the draw is the value to quality on these guys).

I use Gmail on line to get my mail and don't need an additional program for that.  My iPad will do both of those things, so it is not much of a problem.

The keyboard feels like the Mac Book Pro this has replaced.  I have not yet tried to set up wireless printing.It uses Chrome apps and stores it all in the cloud.  I have kept many files on Google drive for years, so I can access them from anywhere and not use disk space.  I also have other files in DropBox and Box.  A word processor is available in Chrome webstore, as well as games.  But my favorite version of Freecell is not.  I have had this computer for about 2 weeks and am still learning what it can do.At first, I was reluctant to buy it because of the small hard drive.  But i bought a pair of tiny 32 Gb flash drives that I have not yet needed to install. It also comes with 100 Gb of space on Google drive to store your files for 2 years.  There is a nominal cost after that.

47,"With nearly 4000 reviews for this Chromebook, I don’t think I could really add anything that hasn’t already been said.  Still, with all the attacks on this convenient little computer I did feel the need to add my two cents.  Our Samsung Chromebook has served us well over the past 8 months.  I used it for the first 6, and then passed it to my son when I purchased an Acer C720.  We have had absolutely no problems with the Samsung, and it has been fun watching Chrome OS evolve and improve over time.  The Chromebooks have shown me that I really don’t need an expensive Windows machine for my home computing needs.  In fact, within a month of owning this computer I had totally abandoned my Windows laptop.  We use the Chromebooks for all manner of web surfing, Netflix, Hulu Plus, Amazon Instant Video, chatting and video calls with Hangouts, creating, editing, and printing documents with Google Docs,  listening to music with Google Play, and I’m even going to use a Chromebook for my taxes this year.  Even though some of the next generation Chromebooks are offering improved speed and longer battery life, this little machine is still an excellent choice for many users.  I also believe that this Chromebook will be remembered as the first affordable Chrome OS device that really brought Chrome computing to the masses.

48,"Got this for my mom who has limited Computer Skills/ability.She checks facebook, gets emails, surfs the web, and occasionally listens to music or watches movies.This is perfect for her.For me, it would not be good because I use my computer for work (and everything) -- I need real software (Indesign, photo editing software, etc.) But for her and people like her, it is a perfect solution.PROS:It is extremely light weight, surprisingly thin, and even though it is made of plastic, it feels relatively nice in the hand.Very quick....surprisingly snappy. Windows open almost immediately. Very short delay when waking up from sleep (quicker than my macbook at times)Relatively good battery life (she gets in the 4+ hour range with normal use)CONS:16gb hard drive can be small if you're using it to store movies (she is) -- I ripped a bunch of her dvds for her and loaded them up. Had to buy an additional 32gb USB drive for more movies. But she has figured out to play them with the internal player (seems to play .m4v and .mp4 files very well; had some hiccups with .avi and .flv...)Audio player is very weak...it will play all songs in a folder in order; that's the extent of it. Using online providers like Pandora is more reliable and enjoyable.Excellent machine overall and for the price - this is a great gift for technically challenged moms and dads...

49,"There's a lot to like about this unit. PROS: It's lightweight. Setup (from opening the box to getting online) is minutes (at most). The screen is beautiful. Once set up (with your Chrome account), there are lots of settings and using the unit is simple. The thing is FAST! From power-up to getting online is maybe 20 seconds, except for one thorny issue I have, for which I have already contacted Samsung. Which brings me to the CONS: You MUST (and there's no way around this) sign into your Chrome account EVERY time you boot this machine. This almost prompted me to send it back. The password must be 8 characters, which is even more annoying. If I'm the only user, why do I need to log in and out? Even if you check ""Keep Logged In"" on your regular Chrome account, you'll have to login every time here. No saving passwords, either. Stupid. Archaic. This alone almost made me send the thing back. After multiple steps, the help menu and poring over the ADVANCED setup (it's not at all like Windows), I was finally able to set my default web page to Google on startup. The Chrome default page requires more clicks to get there every time. Additionally, to place the HOME button in the browser you have to again find the appropriate (and well hidden) settings menu. Once set up (and I hope it never loses its settings), it was fine. The power plug is EXTREMELY small and tight-fitting. I wonder if one good bump on the rear will break it? Time will tell...In actual use, there's more to like (love): Startup and shutdown is a single-button breeze. Connection to my DSL is fast. You can set up any network and allow automatic connecting (storing your password/WEP key). The keypad is large. A row of dedicated ""function"" keys above the number keys makes adjustments of volume, brightness and more pretty simple. After charging, the battery shows 6.5 hours of remaining time. This is great for me - if it really lasts that long (time will tell). Opening the lid automatically boots the machine to save even more time. Unlike with Windows, there are no adjustments (that I have found) for screen timeout/dimming, telling the machine what to do when you open/close the lid or hit the power button. It's simple and straightforward - which essentially was what I wanted, though a bit more customizing would be preferable). Inserting an SD card quickly opened a window of its contents. When initially setting up the unit (or going back later), you can use the built-in webcam to snap your picture or load another as a login profile picture. You can set up many Apps within Chrome and download anything you like to the desktop. Font sizes are adjustable and in many ways like within Windows/IE. There is no delete key, only a backspace key. Odd. Menus are somewhat different than within Windows, but as long as things are there, I'll find them, so I have no major complaints about that. All web pages and Apps I tested loaded faster than either of my PCs with XP or Vista (but then anything is faster than those operating systems), but I say this as a comparative: this Samsung unit overall is very fast, opens and scrolls pages quickly, plays YouTube videos very well and though a bit quirky and limited, setting up the browser is simple. Saving web pages (bookmarking) doesn't provide a traditional Favorites List, but maybe I just haven't figured out how to display it? To be fair, I haven't used Chrome until now, and I'm not a huge fan, but it works. I bought this thing for internet only - no Apps. Oh, and the native GMail pops up in a flash. When I called Samsung for support I got to a knowledgeable (English speaking!) guy in minutes, which was refreshing.Overall, I like it and maybe with a some future software updates, I'll learn to love it. I wold recommend it to anyone looking for a FAST machine that will NOT get viruses (according to Samsung, since there's no OS). If you are afraid of computers but want or need internet and email, this machine is a great choice and is priced right (I paid $249.00 on Amazon).

50,"This is well thought out and I love how it works!Pros:Best rendition yet of this environment.Great battery time...I find it last days in sleep mode and being used every few hours for email or web browsingCharges fast 2 hoursGreat wifi sensitivityGreat keyboardCons:I don't like the screen but cannot really say why...it just does not have any pop and images seem a little washed out.The touch-pad is much too large so it extends under the right palm and tends to get activated while typing.Screen seems to touch keyboard edge when closed and leaves a mark when opened...so far it wipes clean but feat it will wear.I will add more as I live with it longer.UPDATE: 2/15/13 Dropped a star....I have used this exclusively while in Russia. It had no problem with operating from reset in Russian. Just in case others wonder about other language support...The touch pad mouse had become a real deal killer...I cannot type without having to go edit the text at least once a minute. I have tried taping a cover over the end but it does not work much better. I cannot find a way to turn off the touch pad and use just a mouse.Some real problems with Chrome-book OS on Samsung becoming evident...you cannot import contact file from one user to another even though it seems to support the feature in the procedure...possibly Chrome issue.Bad support for Bluetooth devices...if any.I have not found a way to open two windows at a time..trying just opens a new tab.Google+ interface never fully on screen and still do not understand this application...really off the wall.It is great to have something you can use with a keyboard but I find that all I need most of the time is my iPhone unless I want to type a lot and then I am faced with the touch-pad curse!!!!Does not support many android apps and most online apps out of store do not recognize the device for automatic version selection.

51,"I bought this when in graduate school because my campus was so far from my apartment. I needed a lightweight laptop, but couldn't afford the higher end 3lb. models. I found the Chromebook and decided to ask people how it was; my girlfriend has one and after using hers for a while I decided I'd get it.I'll lay out pros and cons. Remember, I'm reviewing this as a graduate student. If you plan on substituting for a PC or Mac, I caution you to understand it doesn't replace those.Pros:Lightweight. Can carry anywhere; less than 3 lbs. is insanely small and easy to fit in a bookbag.Google Chrome OS. Apparently this means no viruses, which is great. Runs smoothly since you're only using the internet (mostly.) Interface is good and everything loads fast.Google Drive. I love drive for group projects and writing notes. Also for reading PDFs and organizing files. It's almost like Office... almost.Comfortable design. Typing on this thing is a breeze. The screen is small but definitely easy to see and read. It's great for watching netflix or reading a book since you can just plop it on your lap while lying down.Cons:No Office. Google Drive is not office. This means that editing something here is not going to download to your PC or Mac the same. Although some times it does, especially in PDF format, and Google seems to be working on an Office Beta prototype. Still, Office is the best around. Drive is great, though, don't get me wrong on that.Everything is connected to the internet. This means that when you listen to spotify, you can only do so if connected (no saved files.) Also, basically everything ceases to function without the internet. Put it this way: without internet, this thing doesn't work.Aside from the cons, this is an excellent machine. Where do you go nowadays that doesn't have internet? People use their laptops at home and starbucks, on campus and in libraries. All have wifi. For the price, it's worth it, especially if you're in college. For anyone not in college, it's great if your laptop breaks, you need a second machine, or if you just want to go online and watch movies/listen to music.Highly recommend!

52,"I purchased this laptop because I needed a device for travel. Initially replacing a Nexus 7 tablet, I found that Chrome OS is more than suitable for professional work abroad.If there's anything to praise it's the keyboard. I'm honestly surprised to have ever seen such a good keyboard on such a cheap laptop. The chassis looks good too, the plastic does not all feel flimsy or cheaply formed. Many people have mistaken this for a Macbook Air and with the 8-10 hours of battery life I get, it does more than what I need it for.No product is perfect, however, and that should also be said for this particular Chromebook which was the middle-ground of the models. The ARM processor is not suitable for most chrome extensions as it fails to meet compatibility requirements set out by many developers. The screen --albeit High Def-- had awkward colour ratios that made it feel almost murky at times , especially in sunlight so it was hard to see outdoors.If you're looking for a Chromebook and want something that is cheap in price but still delivers a certain level of quality, this is the one. Don't expect it to outperform those in the $300 range, but it won't keep you short of your needs either.

53,"I received my Chromebook 4 days ago after a two week wait.  That isn't a bad wait for one of the top two or three selling computer items on Amazon, and it's worth the wait.  I bought it sight unseen, and I couldn't be any happier with my choice.The Chromebook is essentially a non-touchscreen tablet with a keyboard.  It is what netbooks wanted to be but weren't.  It is roughly two inches wider, an inch deeper, and a quarter inch thicker than my first generation iPad and incredibly light with very similar styling.  The keyboard feels ""right"" - the keys are properly sized and spaced and have a natural movement.  There are a few differences that take some getting used to (no outdated caps lock key, for instance), but those are easily overcome.  I especially like the placement of the volume and brightness controls.  The touchpad is very nice - not large enough to get in the way, not too small, although it does not always register my fingers on the first touch.  The screen is bright enough to be seen even with the sun at my back.  The speakers are surprisingly decent and not too tinny with a touch of bass.The battery life is very impressive - I used the Chromebook for all of my surfing, email, and posting for a day without having to recharge.  Whenever I stopped using the device I just closed the screen and it hibernated; when I raised the screen the machine awoke almost instantaneously.  I also like that I can completely lower the brightness of the screen to black - nice if I'm listening to audio and don't need to see what's on the screen.The Chrome experience takes some getting used to.  Pretty much everything is treated like a webpage in the browser;  while there are plenty of items in the Chrome store, very few, if any, are actual applications that run on the machine itself.  I'm still trying to learn how to make my Drive documents available offline, and Google Docs has some differences when compared to Office, but these are to be expected.  There is a learning curve for some keyboard commands and touchpad gestures.  I find myself minimizing the browser instead of the font size at times, and I'm searching for the home button when I reach the bottom of a webpage, but these are minor differences from my usual experience.  I do miss the keyboard shortcut for switching tabs; perhaps I'm missing something.My only complaint so far is that I wish the screen would fold 180 degrees.  When lounging on the couch with the device in my lap I'm tempted to push the screen too far back.  It isn't a major complaint by any stretch.The Chromebook is a good device, but it is a great device for the money.  It seems like the perfect device to pair with a pico projector for sales presentations or for allowing the kids to watch videos while traveling.

54,"Instead of writing a long narrative, I'll just provide the list of pros and cons that I wish I would have seen prior to purchasing this computer.  I got it about 10 months ago (just before last Christmas; it was one of the first produced) and have been using it every day since.Pros:* Price point.  Can't beat that.* Weight.  It honestly feels like I'm not carrying anything - I once picked up the neoprene case and almost didn't realize it was empty.* Battery life.  I kid you not, I have gotten 7 hours out of the battery.  That's 7 hours of use, not 7 hours with the monitor off in sleep mode.* Boot speed.  Almost a year in, boot speed is the same as it always was, and it gets me to the login screen in 3 seconds.  Full login in under 10 seconds.* Crash recovery.  When the computer or a window crashes, Chrome reopens everything the way it was.Cons:* The body is made of plastic. This wouldn't be a big deal, but if you pick it up by the palm rest (like most people do) it causes the touchpad to click.  Likewise, if you rest too much weight on your palms, it causes the mouse to click spontaneously.* As an extension of that, the SD card slot has a door on it.  The plastic on it is total crap.  I can't pinpoint any abuse that would cause this, but mine broke off.* Video capabilities.  The computer can't handle youtube videos in high resolution, much less if you load an AVI onto the machine.* Remember, no executable files.  Everyone should know this already, but you can't install programs on this machine.  Just Chrome extensions.* Processor power.  As best I can tell, for tabs containing mild graphics, the machine maxes out around 5-8 tabs.  I think it may have a memory leak as well, as windows left open for over 24 hours have a habit of crashing.Basically, this is a great computer at an unbeatable price, but you need to go into it being aware of its limitations or you will be disappointed.
            "
55,"Pros:* lightweight* durable (my kid has dropped it off the couch armrest several times on to hard floor and at the worst I just had to click the snap-on clips closed again)* long battery life (about 8-9 hours on a full charge even though it's about 3 months old)* instant on (it really does boot up in about 8 seconds from off, or less than 1 second from sleep)* free updates (Google updates Chrome to a new version about every 6 weeks, this frequently includes new features)* As a bonus, this computer also comes with 12 free uses of Gogo in-flight wifi, that was really easy to set up and use while in flight, just don't expect to watch Netflix during your flight. In-flight wifi in general is too slow for anything besides checking e-mail, facebook and reading articles. The passes do expire after 2 years, I probably won't get full use out of mine.Things to keep in mind:Storage space is limited with this device because it relies heavily on Google's cloud services (Google Docs, Google Drive, Google Music, etc.)Don't expect to do any heavy computer work on this device. You can't install Office on this, or video/photo/music editing software, or computer programming development environments, etc. Instead of Office, you can use Google Docs for document/spreadsheet/presentation editing. I think Google Docs is excellent for my personal needs, but there will be a learning curve for anyone used to Office.In conclusion, I would still recommend this laptop for home use even if it were double the price. The bottom line is, at $250 everyone should own at least one of these devices.

I'm also in the position of teaching my mother-in-law how to use a computer...so need the keyboard for her.Have been a Google fan for years...use Docs, Sheets, Mail, Calendar, etc.  I desired a small laptop that would be good for casual use.  A tablet is out...because no keyboard.So, bottom line...the Chromebook is great for me, and my mother-in-law seems to like it too.An important thing you should consider is the operating system:  It's Chrome.  Not Windows,  Not Apple.  Applications need to exist that will function on the Chrome operating system...else you won't be able to do whatever....  For example, Google Earth does not work on my Chromebook.  Photoshop doesn't work (but I wouldn't consider using it anyway).  The point is...be aware of what you will use the Chromebook for before you purchase it.I am very satisfied with the form factor, the screen the keyboard (though I miss the delete key), and with the ease that it does all of the things that it does do.  The keyboard and screen are great.  The keyboard is silky smooth.Some have mentioned the 'bumped out hinge'.  I like it.

57,"I really like my little Chromebook. It's portable and fast. The battery isn't holding a charge as long as it used to, but that happens with electronics. My only compliant is that some options aren't available that I am used to working since being a PC users. The remote desktop feature isn't compatible with my work PC being one example and there a handful of other small annoyances. I once read a review that called this more of a glorified tablet, and I would somewhat agree. It gives you the keyboard and usability of a computer, but some of the limitations make it more like a table. For my uses (mostly internet) it was a great buy and I will definitely be purchasing another in the future.I also loved that when it arrived, the battery was charged and it worked right out of the box. It was a small thing, but made it that much more exciting.

58,"The screen was inside the case I purchased for it and somehow cracked the LCD inside without having damage on the shell or interior. I don't know how that happens, but it did. Thankfully replacing the screen was not costly or difficult at all. Took all of 5 minutes, but Samsung provides the WORST customer service. I called them, explained that I honestly had no clue as to how the LCD could be damaged with no exterior damage and offered to send photos, they told me to reset the computer and that it was a software issue......... um....no. Anyways, the computer itself has a great battery life, runs most sites that I use, but I do experience issues. If you are using this computer for business and not just for occasional college papers, netflix or the internet, I would not advise you to purchase it. It depends upon internet a lot of the time (although I can access files, offline drive, etc. without it sometimes) it does require it to do a lot of stuff. The free 160GB of free cloud storage comes in handy, and you can access your files from any source. Very light weight, compact, lovely interface, etc. Great for college students. Just make sure if you need certain programs you see if they are compatible with google's operating system. There is no Microsoft Word, Excel, etc. It's all google docs. and sometimes you can't open files. Make sure you are comfortable with file formatting, pdf.'s, etc. Easy to get used to, even though this review is quite long, haha. Worth the few hundred for a laptop, as opposed to spending more.Hope I helped!

59,"I asked for a small laptop for my birthday. I have an Ipad, but I wanted a laptop I could create docs on, surf the net, and check email easily. My Ipad can do all of this, but I missed the feel of a keyboard and laptop. I love this little thing. Very portable, inexpensive and it does just what I need it to. My childrens school issues one of these to each of their middle schoolers, and that is how I found out about them. My son is not fond of it, because he wants to game and such. My daughter loves hers. A lot of reviewers complain about the screen breaking, so far mine has not, and my daughter has had hers since August, with no issues of crashes or breaking screens. I am not too tech savvy, and am pretty low maintenance when it comes to computers, so if you are like me, you will love this. Keep in mind it is a 250.00 computer, so don't expect a Mac. Other things - I can watch Netflix (although the resolution isn't as good as my Ipad), Hulu, Youtube, and I love google docs. Pandora also works great (external speakers recommended). There is a long battery life, and it seems to charge fairly quickly when the battery runs down. This is overall a great small laptop to take to Sbucks, use at home, or at school.

60,"This is an OK product for its price. Its battery is good (but does not last as much as they promise). Due to google cloud storage you do not miss hard disk (though it gets very expensive after a point).My biggest complain is about the invisible button on the touch pad. You can click on the lower half of the touch pad to ""left click"". But in this product the button gets stuck. So it is as good as you are clicking and holding it down for a very very long time. Some times it does not come back unless you click a second time. I have three of these devices and ALL of them have the problem. So they probably have whole batch of faulty devices out there.Another problem with the touch pad is its ability to detect multi-touch. I have noticed that a lot of times it fails to detect multi-touch and you end up ""left clicking"" when you intend to write click. Samsung is trying to copy Apple Macs by providing only left click, but they need to realize that if they need to do a good job of it. A lot of people will prefer to have two separate buttons instead of one so it is ok to stick to old fashioned design.Another very serious flaw is that this device is UNACCEPTABLY (I cannot emphasize it more) slow when browsing pictures from my camera (connected via USB). It may be the software or the hardware, I do not know. But my 6 year old Toshiba laptop does a much better job of it.But it is a perfect device for people whose primary computing needs are email/facebook/netflix. Google docs is a really nice no-cost option for MS office if you are not an advanced/pro user. It serves me well for my basic spreadsheet and word-processor needs. What I truly miss is the Skype App. Wish Microsoft releases it soon.

I will NEVER use Microsoft Office again unless I am forced to.  Google Docs is so much easier and more fun to use, and I have played around and done spreadsheets and a power point with Googles programs---so much easier and functional than Microsoft.  My friend and I were just talking last night, why aren't more people making these Google programs their go to for this stuff???Love that is saves everything in the cloud and that I will not have to worry about losing things anymore if I don't get a chance to back up.  Love that I have zero trouble printing anything from my Wi fi printer.  LOVE the web store!  Battery life is incredible.  First day I played on it for about an hour to get familiar and 2 days later went back to 3/4 battery life without the machine being completely shut down.  Doesn't get hot at ALL, and the keyboard is awesome..identical to the mac keyboard and soooo comfortable to type on.My new favorite device, can't imagine going back to any other notebook after this.

62,"I thought I did my research on this Samsung Chromebook but somehow I missed the part where it doesn't run Skype. Google wants you to run Google+. While that is to be expected, it smacks of Apple in the way they limit certain apps and programs to suit Apple. None of my contacts use Google+ so I hate to think I have to buy another device just to web chat. Otherwise I'd give this little device 5 stars. It is perfect for me in every other way though, very portable, kind of like a hybrid between a tablet and laptop. I'm very happy with the purchase and Amazon was amazing as usual with the fast delivery and smooth transaction.UPDATE: March 5,2013. I still love this Chromebook but I did end up getting a clearance Acer Aspire One D270-1824 for the functions that only a hard drive can perform. I keep it at home and now I have the best of both worlds for just over $400.00. While I'm downloading songs on my Acer I use the Chromebook to surf the web and email in blazing speed without the hang-ups of a hard drive. I use McAfee to keep viruses at bay on my Acer but that's not an issue with my Chromebook. I should mention that the Chromebook updates in literally seconds after you shut the unit down. Because of the hard drive my Acer takes what seems forever to update Windows, McAfee, Adobe, etc. But, I can use Skype on my Acer, not Chromebook. The trade-offs aren't an issue since I bought both devices. It really makes the point that there isn't a single perfect device for everyone because of all the competing programs and platforms.To sum it all up for anyone considering the Google Chromebook the main point of getting a Chromebook for me was simply surfing the web and receiving/sending email. Think of it as a portable web browser without any storage and you'll come to appreciate it for what it truly is, limitations and all. I bring it to work and browse my bookmarked websites and send/read email during lunch. Flip open the top, connect to free wifi and you're online in seconds. No more waiting for the hard drive to boot up and start up programs to load. That's the beauty of a Chromebook.

Just log into your gmail account, and it will port everything (including your bookmarks and chrome app's) automatically.Working in a browser takes a little to get use to, but it seems to be in real time, so if you back up a page on accident while typing notes, you won't lose your work (I had a heart attack thinking I'd done just that and was happy to see when I paged back to my notes that they were all there).The keyboard is small, but the keys are quiet.  No insane tap tap tapping to cause a distraction.All in all, this is exactly what I wanted, what I paid for, and what I expected.

64,"I wanted a device mainly for blogging, social networking, Skyping so my son can be connected with the grandparents, and streaming videos.  The price of the Chromebook was certainly right, and I was willing to forego Microsoft computing to try it.  I still haven't gotten fully into Google Docs, but then I haven't had a real need for word processing since I've owned it (about a month now).  I'm loving how lightweight it is as well as the keyboard.  The gestures for the touchpad are a bit different and took a couple days to get used to, but it's no problem now - though I do get frustrated when I'm using a regular tablet PC at work and it doesn't respond to the gestures!  The biggest downfall that I can see so far, is that it has gotten into the habit of pausing a video with no way to resume unless you restart it, and of shutting down while streaming videos.  I'm not sure if this is the device or the interface with Hulu though.  I don't recall this problem with Amazon streaming (which I was mostly doing the first couple weeks), but it has become so problematic with Hulu, in the last couple weeks that I actually switched to tv.com (still shuts down, but doesn't get stuck mid-video).  Also, I haven't been able to get Skype - I thought there was a web-based way to do it, but I can't seem to find it (if anyone knows how, I'm all ears), so we've been using Google Hangout, which is adequate, but the quality doesn't seem to be quite as good as Skype.  All in all, this is definitely worth the cost, but it does have a few glitches that could be difficult to deal with depending on how you want to use it.

65,"Edited 3/12/2013:I purchased the 11-in Samsung Chromebook as a gift when they went on sale for $250. This major price-shift in the chromebook line took it from (IMHO) overpriced, to competitively priced. Because of the new price-point, you can think about this as a budget friendly laptop (if you use mostly web apps) or tablet replacement. Especially if you're someone who does a lot of typing and isn't a fan of doing it on tablet screens!I don't use it much myself, but I've talked with the recipient extensively, and this is a summary of their thoughts. They're a professional video editor who uses this as a supplemental portable computer when traveling, or just around the house where the have wi-fi and don't want to be chained to a serious editing station computer.Form: This is a compact, sexy looking laptop. Although it's plastic, it's well built, slim, and finished to look like brushed aluminum. Very nice. Notably, the keyboard is a full sized for normal human hands. I sort of expected it to feel cramped, but it feels normal sized and eminently usable.Specs: Screen is 1366-by-768 (16:9) so while you won't be able to view full 1080p video, 720 video looks great though. Dual Core processor w/ 2gb ram made web browsing with numerous tabs open quite snappy. Performance does drop off a bit if you're one of those crazy people who has to have 20 or 30 or 40+ tabs open at the same time. Camera is unequivocally made for things like skype, not for taking high-def pictures, but it suits its purpose just fine. For ports, you've got one each of USB 2.0, USB 3.0, and HDMI, so you can connect a mouse if you want or link it up to your TV for streaming HD video! There is a card reader for SD/SDHC/SDXC and audio has a mic input and headphone output. Local storage is somewhat compact at 16gb, but this is compensated by google drive access (100gb free for two years!) and can be supplemented by dropbox, amazon cloud, skydrive, etc.Web Apps: The giftee already lived extensively in the google web-app environment so they jumped right in! When I purchased it, this came with two years of 100gb google drive storage. Pretty cool. Otherwise web apps and such work just the way you expect them to work.Overall: If you want a super portable and very stylish laptop, you're comfortable working in the google environment of web apps, you have ready access to wi-fi, and you're on a budget so you don't want to shell out ~$1000 for a mac air, this is a fantastic product.Negatives:1) You really need to have wi-fi access to use this most effectively. Evaluate your wi-fi accessibility carefully before you take the plunge, and note that your local storage is limited to 16gb. Without that extra 100gb of google drive, or access to your dropbox/amazon cloud/skydrive you can easily feel the constrained.2) There is no support for netflix. Presently, every chromebook EXCEPT for this one (Samsung, ARM based) can stream netflix. Hulu and Amazon streaming both work fine but this is a pretty glaring negative for folks who are thinking about a chromebook for its portability and access to web apps.EDIT:The Samsung Chromebook now supports netflix streaming. I'll leave the original review for posterity, but negative #2 is effectively removed. I don't think it bumps this chromebook up to a 5th star, as negative #1 still stands, but it's a very nice improvement, and I'm very glad that google/samsung kept their commitment to netflix support!

66,"I have had this chrome book for almost four months. I love it. I have 2 laptops, 1 desktop, and a tablet, but being a writer I needed something more. I got tired of getting up in the middle of the night and booting up my desktop or laptop, and waiting to add dialogue or characters. The chrome book is fast, boots up ASAP! I use Google Drive primarily to write my chapters, then they instantly sync to my laptop, so I can edit them and transfer to word. It's very light and easy. Nothing to deal with, all the VP is taken care of, all of the updates, it's perfect.The MAJOR thing that drove me out of my mind was there is NO DELETE!  Drove me crazy until I figured out google's idea of the ""delete"" button. I love all of the google programs, but DRIVE is awesome. It saves everything every seven minutes, and once I thought I lost a few chapters, I was able to retrieve them via the drive.My BFF is computer stupid~she admits it(LOL) so for her birthday I am buying her this chrome book. When she had a laptop, she never updated any of the virus, nothing.....she could hardly figure out email, let alone facebook and ebay. This is perfect for her. Everything is already loaded, it updates automatically, the Virus Protection is built in, basically everything she needs or will want this Chrome book has. She will be so surprised when she comes home from her trip on the 14th, and finds this chrome book..plus we'll be able to video chat(ok we only live 5 doors apart) but it might be fun.DO NOT LET PEOPLE talk you out of SQUARE TRADE WARRANTY! I have used them on all my devices, cameras, and tv's. My one DVD player was on it's last year of warranty and it just quit. They took care of me, and it was repaired and back playing my discs within a week. I'm lucky that was the ONLY time I've ever had to use it, but I am glad I have it...my dvd player cost me 300$(region free) so the 45$ I paid at that time for 3 years was worth it. I would rather have it and never use it, then need it and be hosed, and yes I am purchasing the protection plan for my BFF, her track record of ""accidents"" with electronics is mind boggling, so it's a worth while investment.

67,"I needed a platform powerful enough to do content production (typing in a text editor) and the usual internet stuffs, but cheap enough that if I destroyed it because it was in my backpack while I was riding my skateboard and I fell, I wouldn't be too terribly upset.What I didn't realize was that the Chromebook ties in to my google account and synchronizes the state of the device, so were I do destroy this device and need to replace it, I wouldn't even need to do any data migration or reconfiguring from the damaged device.I was no expecting a laptop level experience from this device.  I have had lots of fun and frustration trying to get this device to do things it is not currently designed to do.  The fact that I can run this device in ""developer mode"" and I get a no-kidding bash shell with ssh allows me to forgive all the quirkiness of the platform that Google brings in the effort to make this a super secure mobile user platform.  Chromebook is Linux (hardened Gentoo, I believe), but if you don't really know Linux that deeply then you may have a hard time getting it to do what you want if you just want a Linux box.But hey, if you do just want a Linux box, there are plenty of guides out there for how to flip this thing to an Ubuntu or Debian install, either installing on a separate SD card or on the main internal flash itself, if you're so bold.

68,"My Samsung Chromebook seems to be a little spartan on keyboard stuff compared to my old laptop and takes a little getting used to without all the laptop's bells and whistles, but right out of the box it leaped onto the internet and zips around doing the things I like to do without a hitch...all except connecting to my printer.  There is a way to connect to the printer according to the Chromebook's instruction manual, but I've yet to understand how to do it.  So I tried searching for a printer that is compatible with the Chromebook and simple to set up and operate.  I think I found one for about $149...I'm not sure.  The uncertainty has a lot to do with Chromebook's ""Cloud"" technology.  After paying less than $25 each for my last two printers, $149 gives me sticker shock, so I didn't buy the one I found on line.  Not being able to print stuff is a bummer.  Having to pay six times more for a printer that ""might"" be compatible is not good, especially when the printer was given mixed reviews on reliability.  Otherwise, I like the Chromebook with its Lenox based operating system a lot better than Windows XP, 7, and 8.  It's thin, light, and very portable.

69,"After a couple hours with this bad boy, I figured I had the justice to write the review.  So here we go.The Good:+ Loving the matte screen.  It's very anti-glare, and has a VERY crisp image+ Google Chrome is not as bad as I thought it would be as an OS...+ The keyboard is something I was able to get used to decently fast+ It's very compact, and lightweight+ It's perfect for students, or office work!+ Love the multi-touch mouse pad!+ It has a webcam, but if you use Skype to video chat, read #1 in ""The Bad""The bad:- It's locked down, meaning you cannot install anything except what Google Chrome has to offer.  Therefore, no things like Skype until Google decides they want to add it, if ever.- The power button is right above the backspace, and right were delete usually is, so dont miss! ;)- The mouse pad, and clicker are one thing, therefore, if you are using 1 finger to navigate, and the other to click, you may end up moving the mouse in two different directionsThe ugly:Nothing yet... it's pretty sleek lookin!Verdict (TL/DR) - It's a great laptop.  The size and weight make it insanely portable, but also make it feel like it is not very tough, so you are likely to have to take good care of it in your travels.  The Google OS doesnt fail as hard as I was assuming it would have, but it does severely limit the point of having a laptop.  For those of you who want a laptop, and plan to use it a lot for Skype, dont get a Chromebook.  However, if you are more of a Google Hangouts person, it should be fine for you.  Otherwise, I would really give this my suggestion for students like myself.  It's something simple to take to class for notes and such, and will get the job done.  Just wish Google would allow us more freedom with it.

70,"No but really - I do love it. I open it - it starts. Period. Super fast. No virus worries, great battery life, great screen. I bought it to replace a Windows 8 touch screen PC that I bought to replace a Windows 7 PC that was stolen. The Windows 7 PC I could have trucked along with for a few more years, but the Windows 8 PC was a joke. Windows 8 looks so cool on the Surface commercials, but it's just ridiculous on a laptop. So I returned it after 2 weeks and bought my Chromebook just to tide me over till I could choose a 'real' PC and decide where to land in the new Windows landscape. I'll never go back. Windows 8 made me a Chromer for life. The first 2 weeks I had it I had to watch TV on it cause my TV got stole up too, and it was fantastic. Netflix and most of my U-verse online content looked great. Surprisingly, the sound was much better than the Windows 8 machine I'd had for a bit.If I could, I'd shave off like a 3rd of a star on account of there is no delete key. I really miss that and am not getting used to being without it.  I'd also nick that 5th star a bit for the action of the mouse 'buttons' embedded in the touchpad. You have to really bang them to activate, so selecting text is very awkward. I have to use my left hand to hold down the left mouse 'button' in order to select. But I am getting used to that. Also, weirdly, the camera APP that comes with the Chromebook, doesn't work. At all. Apparently everyone knows that and the solution is to just go to the play store and get a new one. It's almost like you're being set up to see how easy it is to replace software compared to a PC. I was alarmed at first that something so fundamental didn't work; but 10 seconds later, when I had a new app that worked perfectly, I was sold on the Chromebook.Overall, I love it and am perfectly happy with the Google Drive universe.

71,"This chromebook is absolutely perfect for college life. The small size is perfect for the small desks in almost every classroom I am in. The best part is Google docs on the chromebook; I can easily bring up a google word doc page and start taking notes for each class and it automatically saves itself. I can later go home and use either my laptop or my pc and make any changes and properly save it for later review. YouTube videos are really smooth for study breaks when I'm not in class, and away from my laptop or pc.

72,"Have had my 3G/wifi  11.6-inch Chromebook for about 7 months and I can't be happier with it! It's super light weight, nicely priced, compact, has a full size keyboard and a nice sized screen, a welcome change from my android and Kindle Fire screen size.  It's a joy to use for typing documents and emails, and because of the size and feather weight I like to take it everywhere.  This was my definite go-to device on my last vacation.Unlike on my Dell laptop's touchpad, the touchpad on the Chromebook is actually nice to use. Once you go through a quick and easy tutorial, you realize it works like a charm.  I like the two-finger scrolling feature, and also how tapping the touchpad with 2 fingers has the same function as right-clicking on a mouse and other options. I find the touchpad to be quite responsive and ergonomically better for me than a mouse. I have never had a need to connect a mouse to the Chromebook, and that's a bonus since I like to travel light. I don't miss it, though if you want to plug in a mouse you can.My Dell laptop is sitting around collecting dust these days, but nice to know it's still there if I need it to do something more highpowered using software.  Frankly, I don't do much computing at home, and the chromebook works better, without the bulk and bog-down from software.  I expect Chromebooks will become even more high-powered in the future.  In the meantime this does what I like and I know automatic improvements are constantly being made behind the scenes.There have been some occasions when I've lost my house wifi and Sprint tower service to my android due to a wind storm and power outage.  I was able to quickly get back on line again with the 3G (via Verizon) feature and I still had 6 hrs of battery life to take advantage of.  It came in really handy in that emergency, and in places where I don't have wifi and really need to connect up for a bit. The 100 MB of included data per month isn't a lot, though I have yet to use up 100MB in a month's time. It's definitely an added convenience I'm glad I have. If I want more data temporarily, I can buy it. Haven't had to.I can surf the web, study for my exams, read kindle books, pdfs, read/write google docs, watch movies on Netflix, YouTube, play flash player content, and videos from a huge number of sites. Play with and create experimental apps, or download a huge number of proven  apps. Listen to my podcasts on Stitcher, Tune-in radio, connect to the ethernet too -- had to buy an adaptor for a few bucks. I can insert a memory card, connect a thumb drive to it, or my 1 TB backup drive to read, listen to or transfer files to or from.  I can store files in the cloud, or on the chromebook itself. I can also wirelessly transfer files via the Airdroid app.A few cons:I can connect the chromebook to my TV's hdmi, but I can't play Amazon instant videos, which is a shame.  Currently have to watch Amazon videos from my Dell laptop or my Kindle Fire (on the otherhand the Kindle Fire won't let me watch YouTube on hdmi, only on it's little screen, and it doesn't play flash content).(UPDATE!! You can now watch full length streaming Amazon instant videos. Previously only the short trailer versions of movies could be watched on the Chromebook. Thanks for paying attention to your reviewers Amazon and Chromebook!)Another thing I don't appreciate is that you can't make Skype calls from the Chromebook 11.6.  They do have the Google Hangouts app pre-loaded for making calls. I've never used it so can't comment on it, though I hear it works well for making video calls on the Chromebook.  I don't know if I will use it, will see.  I don't need another call app, another account to worry about.  I'll just use the Skype app on my android or computer.The good thing about Chromebook is that there are always changes and improvements being made behind the scenes.  For example, where previously Netflix wasn't available on this device just a few months ago, now it is.  I hope Amazon works with the manufacturer and makes their instant videos available on it too, (Update!: Previously only Amazon video trailers could be watched, Now Full length Amazon videos can be streamed!) and that Skype calls will also be able to be made from it.The other thing I miss is a back-lit keyboard when I'm in a dimly lit room. I realize that not having it saves battery life and that's a valid trade-off, though a lot of times I like to sit and work with it plugged in to power anyway. I think for future designs it would be nice to have the option to turn a keyboard back-light feature on or off. I guess I could clip on a book light so I can see the keyboard at those times, but that's just one more thing I have to cart around with me that I'd rather not.Overall I am extremely happy with my purchase, would highly recommend it, and expect I will get a lot of use out of it for quite some time to come.

Because, for most things I want to do, it just works better.It's not as fast as the Mac, doesn't have as big a screen, and can't run Mac software, but none of that actually matters for the things I want to use a laptop for - email, google docs, web browsing, videos, etc.What really matters is:* It's lighter - much more comfortable in my lap, or when carrying it around the house* It's cheaper - I can abuse this thing without having to worry so much about breaking it* Cooler - I'm using it on bare legs while wearing shorts. The MacBook Pro would burn by legs* It starts faster - great when you suddenly realize you want to write an email* It's simpler - Never worry about viruses, data loss, or messed up configs. I'm buying one for my parents* It does everything I actually want to do

74,"I'm really enjoying my Chromebook. I'm currently using it for web browsing, email, and simple image processing, but this fall, I took it with me on a cross USA bicycle tour where I also used it to create web pages - 45 of them - on the crazyguyonabike.com web site. Without wifi, I used Pixlr Touch Up to edit and re-size images for my web pages and Text to create the text for the pages. Then, when I had wifi, I used Chrome to upload the text and images and edit the web pages after crazyguy  created them using my images and text.My tour was from North Carolina to California. Roughly in the middle of the tour, in Norton, Kansas, I dropped my Chromebook. I was in line at a McDs, getting a snack. My Chromebook was tucked under my left arm. Ir slipped out and fell about four feet to the tile floor. It hit on one corner, bounced several times and clattered to rest on the floor. As I picked it up, some one said ""Did it break?"" and I replied, ""I don't know."" After I got my snack and sat down. I opened it and saw no damage, so I turned it on and used it to check my email.After I got to my motel that night. I noticed that many of the clips that hold the the plastic shells around both the display and the main part of the computer were opened. I carefully worked around both shells, pressing them back together and all of the  clips that were open clicked back into place. The only damage I could fine was a little marring, about 1/4"" wide, on the front left corner. I don't think any of the many laptop computers I have owned, including several Toughbooks, would have survived that fall with so little damage.Since I use it for photo editing, I wish it had more accurate color rendering on its display. Since I camp sometimes on tour and may be away from power outlets for several days, I also wish it had a swap-able battery so I could carry a spare. Its battery is replaceable, but that requires removing the bottom shell and unscrewing six screws which I wouldn't want to do on tour. Battery life is good - around six hours - and I carry an Anker external battery brick which can power the Chrome book for another four or five hours. That is good enough for me to create several days of web pages off line when I am camping.

75,"After reading a lot of reviews I had a pretty good idea of what to expect and have not been disappointed.  Things I like best are the simple and streamlined operating system, the great keyboard, quick start up and generally fast action from one website to another.  It is highly portable and has long battery life so is great for outdoor writing or to take along to the library or laundromat to watch something from Prime.  It doesn't do everything a laptop does, but used in combination with my older xp machine it is a perfect combination.  With the chromebook I do my email, watch Amazon prime, catch up on the daily news and satisfy my curiosity with web searches. When I want to upload and edit pictures in Picassa or watch a DVD I use the XP laptop.  I use the laptop very little for internet use where it is the most vulnerable to virus infestations and such and where the Chrome OS is pretty safe from hackers, viruses, etc.  By limiting the laptop use it will serve for a lot longer than it would have and won't bog down as easily as other Microsoft OS machines have in the past.  I sit the little Samsung on top of my closed laptop and type away, writing this review.  I don't have the money for an expensive machine to do everything, but with this combination I have the best of both worlds on a senior's budget.Silverbear

76,"I love this internet powerhouse machine.  We all know about the portability, low price, and long battery life.  The benefits really come from the quality.  The screen is nice, the keyboard is responsive, and the touchpad is amazing.  I've had lots of laptops and this is by far the most responsive touchpad.  I was planning on using a mini mouse with the nano dongle, but there is no need.  The biggest negatives for me are the SD card slot needs to either be microSD / fit the card all the way in and the keyboard could be back-lit for low light conditions.I'm getting used to working in the cloud, but I was pleasantly surprised at how fast it was to set up (not to mention boot up) because I use Chrome Browser as my regular.  It automatically loaded those apps.  I browsed the Chrome Store for more and found a few nice little gems to replace some of my windows programs which make the Chromebook even better.The major thing that I recommend you do after you set this up, is to change your settings to require the password after it goes to sleep.  Otherwise, anyone who steals or find this thing can get into your entire Google world.  Your Gmail, Youtube, Play Store accounts, etc. could be compromised.Edit: I should add that I have been vehemently opposed to buying Samsung products because of a bad experience with an expensive video camera and terrible customer service that left me with nothing, but the specs on this device still pulled me in.

(so it does Everything I need it do to)...  and it small, fits in a back pack...So I got us both one for the cost of a new lap top & after reading the lap top reviews I was NOT impressed, I am actually scared of Windows 8 after the feedback in the reviews, I was already a bit sour since the Microsoft update crashed the original lap top!  So why not?I love it!  I use it for all of the above, you are able to type & send it in the options field as a word type document.I have not yet figured out how to link it to my printer but I have a desk top I use for most print jobs.It will actually just stop you when you try to access a site it deems unsafe, where certificates are not up to date or where known issues have occured.  It loads in a second, it light weight, has good battery life, The screen is a bit small but it does fit in a back pack and the key board is also a bit small, but, If i really want to go to town and type something like this review up I can always plug my ergo key board in and type away!You can not download software to it, it comes pre loaded with most of what I am guessing 17 yr olds need and want.As long as I can access my needed sites, mainly my E*Mail, bank & snapfish, I am good!

It's fast, doesn't heat up, and is super quiet. A nice contrast to my Alienware M17. But I wanted a computer I could use that could go without being plugged in after 45 minutes. SOmething less than 20 pounds. And this computer fits that need.Plus, for the 200 bucks I paid, I don't feel like I got ripped off. In fact, it's surprising how responsive this computer is. It stutters on some things, but for real basic needs it's good enough. Especially if you're already using a lot of Google's services, like All Access, or Docs. It's such a good value, I bought one for my mom who is a writer, and she loves it.I feel like I got something about as useful as a modern day Apple laptop, for 90% of what apples cost. You probably won't use something intensive like photoshop or music editing software, but if you're looking at $200 dollar computers, you probably don't need those services.It's a solid little computer that I don't regret buying at all.

79,"I'm a student. I need something to carry around that I won't worry about losing, breaking, or someone stealing. I won't bring my Apple laptop to school due to theft increases lately. On that note, I wanted something for web browsing, typing papers in the library egg chairs and had a keyboard/trackpad combo. I found it.This is not for a poweruser. Don't fool yourselves, people. It's a tablet on steroids. Get that through your head when you purchase and use it. If you have any other expectations like some of the reviewers, well, you're honestly not the target audience. It's meant to be light and cost affordable. Sure, the screen isn't high resolution and it lacks expandable RAM and HD space. That's NOT what this computer is.I've had the computer for a few days now and I love it. It's not super fast by any means; however, it gets the job done in regards to web browsing, finding papers for literature reviews and listening to rdio or Pandora. That's what I need this for. And most likely the average consumer. Face it, most college students buy $1000 Macbooks to look cool. For what? To facebook, stream music, and browse the web. Most people who do photo editing buy the 15"" models with maxed out specs (like me). I don't want to bring that to campus. That's too much money to be slinging in my bag to just browse the web.So, let me be clear. This laptop is excellent. The build quality is amazing for the price. Build quality is great of which I was surprised. The keyboard reminds me of the Macbook and the track-pad keeps up with my fast paced motions quite well. It's light and I can have four to five tabs open running different processes at ease. It does like to stutter when I do multiple things with a video running though. Expected for a tablet processor though. It keeps cool and charged for a days use. The front camera is great for chatting.I will admit, this little computer will replace your daily use computer you lug around currently. I used the Chrome Remote Desktop today on campus and was amazed at the speed and ease. I was using my Macbook at home on campus without any hiccups like I experience with Logmein or those other clients. Accessing the 100GB of free storage was as simple as clicking a link. My music, documents and life are on the cloud. I can access them with ease. Printing is no problem for me, either.This little beast will surprise you. Although, please, don't expect the world from this laptop. It's $250, folks.P.S. I typed this from the Chromebook. No problems handling my typing speed. And ask questions if you need them answered.UPDATE 11/24:I've been using this for a good while now and I haven't had any regrets. The computer does what I need, when I want and I only miss running Netflix at school. That's ok though, I have other avenues for watching movies. They do plan on updating and that's a problem with Netflix, not Google. Printing is simple as it seems to be a very common question. To clicks on your computer and you're done. They have been updating the OS and the Chromebook is acting a little better now. Overall, I'm still loving it. Just remember, it's NOT for everyone.UPDATE 02/06/13:I love this computer. It is all I use around campus and for class lectures. I barely use Microsoft Office for my notes or spreadsheets in class. Google Drive and their office version is just awesome. If you do a lot of team-based activities, please, just use Google Drive. Keep your documents available to you at all times and collaboration is simple. It has made my life much easier. Just thought I'd let you all know.UPDATE 04/11/13:Netflix now works!UPDATE 07/10/13:Now that the school season is upon us, I thought I would go ahead and write an update of my handy-dandy little Chromebook. Let's just say, it's still alive and working. Drops, falls, and tosses across the couch and slides across the table this little tabcom is doing well. Software wise, Google has been working at it and getting all the bugs out of the system to provide an even more fluid experience. I love having the ability to use Google Print from ANYWHERE I am and have it waiting for me when I need it. Everything syncs up across platforms and this has really come in hand during projects. Just try the Google Docs as a team compared to Word with Review and you won't go back when doing initial collaboration. Battery is still holding up to 8-10 hours (I know, right)- that's with smart use of the brightness. I honestly don't know what else to say. It works and is the perfect complement for my Macbook that is collecting dust at home. The Macbook is used via my Google Remote Connection and it's just wonderful. No lag or anything like I've had with LogMeIn and the other one. And like always, ask questions if you have them. And I almost forgot to add that Spotify works in the browser just as well as the PC version. Netflix, Hulu, Amazon streaming does work contrary to the other review posted saying the opposite. Cheers!FINAL UPDATE:The Chromebook is an excellent computer for those looking for something light. It won't do everything a full laptop will do and there are privacy concerns of the all-mighty Google. The question to ask yourself though is if you are really secure online? You can get a better laptop as some commentators have stated and that is very true. You can get a nice, heavy computer to carry around and worry about. This Chromebook offers you peace of mind that you can throw it around and not worry about it being stolen (as long as you have a good password on your Google account). It works for me and I'm sure it works for the MAJORITY of others. I've had it for nearly a year and it is only getting faster, not slower. I hope you will take the time to see if it works for you. If not, we live in a world full of other gadgets and tools to fit our lives. I will be removing myself from the comments as there has been a strong output of support from other owners. Live long and prosper!

80,"Unfortunately I am not able to give an objective review about my snazzy new Chromebook 3G because I am so amazed with it.I would need to spend an extra $1000 to get a better laptop than this (a MacBook Air). Nothing in the Windows world is close (and I own a Windows 8 laptop).Where to start?It plays video! YouTube, and even connects perfectly to my home Plex media server! All my TV shows and movies are right here.Quiet! No fan. No buzz. And it stays cool.Light. Very light.Excellent keyboard. They chose to remove unneeded keys so that the important keys would be full-sized. Trackpad also works great.All my bookmarks and passwords showed up as soon as I logged in with my Google account.All this for $250??? (or in my case, $330 with 3g). And you still get a camera, SD card, 2 USB ports, and HDMI. That's crazy!!!!The Chrome apps are a little boring, hopefully that picks up.One niggle, is that I wish this had a touch screen as I find the lightweight and form factor has me thinking I am using a tablet with a keyboard. The trackpad is excellent, though, and much better than the one on my Acer.

81,"This has not held up with time. Purchased it in 2013, writing this in 2016 on the chromebook. It regularly chokes when loading webpages and cannot stream/display content above 720p. Sometimes even that makes it jump/stutter. When it starts downloading an update in the background performance drops even more.Honestly, quite frustrating to use beyond simplest of tasks. Consider this particular model as more of an electronic notebook, good for accessing google docs, gmail, and if you ask really nicely, will take you a few places on the internet.That said, I have been using this for three years and only paid a few hundred for it. It's come with me on extended trips to Europe and Asia, so it definitely served its purpose. Just lower your expectations on performance. Oh, and I could never get the usb 3 port to function as usb 3.

82,"First off, I am an admitted IT Geek.  I have a computer science degree and have spent my entire career working in IT on everything from mainframes to wearable computers.  I really know computers inside and out.  I want to provide some perspective about the Chromebook by a person who spends 10-12 hours on some type of computing device every day.So why would I ever buy a device like this?  Well, I ordered the Chromebook to evaluate it for my parents.  They are not tech savvy at all.  They have a Kindle Fire and an iPad, but when they do write e-mails and want to do other tasks, the pads are just not enough.  They are computer users and media consumption people.  What I found out during my work with the Chromebook is that it is the right computer for me too.  Now, off to the review...First off the Google Chromebook is computer unlike anything coming from the minds of Apple or Microsoft.  Something on the surface that an IT Geek like me probably wouldn't like.  It doesn't have a full-blown operating system like OSX nor is it a mobile platform like Android.  It is something in between, it is ChromeOS.  It is very fast, very reliable, and is perfect for doing your  everyday tasks.  If you mostly read e-mail, write notes, run spreadsheets, develop presentations, chat, Facebook, and surf, you should read on.The Samsung Chromebook is very sleek, thin, and light.  It is somewhat similar in form to a Macbook Air, but it's also close to a number of the new Ultrabooks.  The feel in hand is very solid and doesn't seem like a $249 computer.  The keyboard is very good; very solid feel and great action.  If you type quickly (100+ wpm), you'll be happy to know this keyboard can keep up with you.  The only better keyboard I've used in recent memory is the Air, but it's not far off.When you open the box and lift the lid it automatically starts up in under 10 seconds.  This is not coming up from sleep mode.  That's its boot time from a cold start.  The setup process is as painless as it can be.  Attach it to your wireless network and if you have a gmail account, just login and you are done.  I up and reading e-mail in my account in less than 5 minutes.  The last out of the box Windows experience took nearly an hour before I was through all of the setup questions, patches, and add-ons.Now that you are logged in, the simplicity of the system reveals itself.  Effectively the entire Chromebook is a dedicated Chrome browser.  Almost everything you do is in a Chrome browser window.  There are applications included and that can be installed, but they all run inside of the Chrome framework.  It is a new way to think about computing.  And boy is it fast.About the speed: Wow is the best way to describe it.  I dare you to find a browser that is as responsive as the Chrome broswer on ChromeOS.  All running on a tiny little ARM processor.  This tiny little ARM processor is what gives the Chromebook its 7+ hour run time on a single charge.  In practice a lot of this depends on what you are doing.  If you want to stream 7 hours of YouTube videos, you're probably going to be disappointed, but for practical all-day off the charger use, I'm seeing that performance easily.  It also charges like lightening, so if you throw it on the charger for an hour at lunch, you won't need to worry about it into the evening.Back to why I am keeping the Samsung Chromebook.  The device does what I need to do 95% of the time during my work day and 99% for the rest of my life.  All of this in a very sleek, inexpensive, and portable package.  I still have my work computer, a Lenovo i7 based monster, but it is huge, heavy, and doesn't have nearly the battery life or portability of the Chromebook.  I now leave that laptop in the docking station on my desk and carry around the Chromebook and that is the computer I take home.  I suppose if I was still spending the majority of my time writing C# I would need a different tool, but the Chromebook is the right tool for me.Pros and Cons?This introduces an interesting point of view.  What can we really compare the Chromebook to?  There is nothing else that is in it's class, so I guess I'll focus primarily on functionality.Pros:-Inexpensive (I didn't say cheap)-Light-Fast-All Google-Centric  (this can also be a Con)-Very simple to setup and use-Long battery life-Good build quality-Good keyboard-Good library of add-on applications (yes, another app store)-Everything for one price (Hardware, Operating System, Storage, Office Applications)Cons:-Not a full-blown operating system-Doesn't run Mac, iOS, Windows, or Android applications...none of them, it can't-All Google-Centric (this can also be a Pro)-Some apps you know and love aren't available yet, maybe never (Netflix is one)-Not as mainstream as either full-blown computer platforms or mobile platformsI gave the Samsung Chromebook 4 stars because it's really good, but not perfect.  Bottom line, this is a new device that lives somewhere between tablets and full-blown traditional computers.  It is a great consumption device with a full keyboard for doing some serious work (documents, spreadsheets, presentations, e-mail, and web-based applications).  I recommend that you give it a shot, I think you'll really like it.

83,"I love samsung chromebook. For everyday utility purposes I very much prefer it over the more expensive laptops or desktops that offer windows.  It's lightning fast, hassel-free, and never gets sick. The one problem I have experienced with this particular model (both the one I bought new several years ago and now this used one) is that they Have a problem streaming Netflix.  Since it is lightning quick with all other things internet-related, I suspected problem must lie with  with the chromebook-compatible version of the Netflix app. But apparently that isn't the case. I recently bought a newer model and it doesn't seem to have this problem.This purchase is the older model and was used so my expectations were tempered with a little skepticism.  I am fairly happy with my purchase.  So far, the only feature I have found that isn't functioning is it's sleep mode.  I didn't adequately appreciate how awesomely convenient that feature is until It was gone.  I could be right in the middle of a complicated task with a dozen pages open, and if suddenly interrupted I only need to close the lid to instantly cut off power, or just walk away and power will cut off automatically after 15 mins or so.  No need to close any apps, save, bookmark, log out or power down.  I can return to task 20 hrs later. Just open the lid or touch the mouse pad and it's back on with plenty of charge left- all the pages just as I left them. I checked the power settings to make sure sleep mode is turned on. It is.  But this computer does not sleep when the lid is closed or left idle.  If it is not literally powered off it will continue to operate until battery is completely drained.  I can live with that I guess. it's just something I will need to get used to.

84,"Used this laptop for schooling only with Pennfoster veterinary assistant course and found that it was exactly what I needed for taking online schooling. It may not perform well for gaming...but it performs everything else flawlessly such as email, social networking sites, homework, and online forums. It was the fastest laptop I have ever used for boot up time and accessing websites. It was my reliable companion for schooling for 2 whole years and never once failed me. I highly recommend it for college students who won't be doing much gaming but will be doing everything else a college student does. It does play videos really well and without lag for people who need to do videos. It does have options for word processor type functions, excel type functions, and power point although they are a spin off by Google. They work almost as well as Microsoft Office.

85,"Bought this almost 3 years ago and it still works! (Purchased: November 27, 2012.)The only major issue I have had so far was the screen going out. However, that turned out to be an extremely simple fix. The cord that connects the monitor to the actual computer was coming unhooked. However 3 years of opening and closing this laptop daily will most likely cause issues with any laptop. All I had to do was carefully take off the frame around the computer screen. Unscrew 12 screws and gently plug the cord back into the monitor. Now it is working just like the first day I opened it back in 2012. It is currently 2015 and this has been my daily computer since I got it. I would definitely buy another.Pros: Great for browsing the web. Google offers a lot of features to do school work online (Microsoft office alternatives.) However, I believe Microsoft Office now has browser versions of their applications. Fantastic light-weight laptop that works for browsing the web. Decent battery life, but after 3 years it has lost some of the original battery duration. I think it was originally 6 hours and now I get 3 - 4 hours.Cons: I do experience lag often, videos can sometimes be skippy, has gotten slower with age & numerous updates. I powerwash mine once a month to keep it running smoothly as I notice lag when the on board memory begins to get filled up.It is a ""cloud"" computer. The storage memory is 16gb, but only 11gb is usable since the OS needs space on the storage as well. If you just need a small, inexpensive laptop to browse amazon, reddit, google, youtube, listen to music, etc. I recommend this. Would I suggest buying this model specifically? Probably not in 2015 as there are plenty of different chromebooks that have been released in the past 3 years. Most of them have better specs and are either cheaper or the same price as this one. Go for a newer model. However, this is a fantastic laptop and if it ever drops to $99 I will definitely buy another 2012 model.

86,"My high rating takes into account the fact that the seller was for some reason asking only $56 (shipped) for a used model on Amazon.  I bought it because I couldn't resist paying only $56 and thought it might be fun to play around with, not because I needed another laptop. But it turns out I am using this daily instead of my aging Lenovo x220 Windows 10 laptop, which works but is no longer portable due to problems with the case.If I had to pay more for this than $56, I would lower the rating to 4 stars because of the inherent limitations of the Chrome operating system.Chrome was not originally designed to run software other than as extensions to the Chrome browser, but  a lot of extensions are available, enabling you to do quite a variety of things both offline and online.  Check out the Chromebook app store to see what is available.  For example the Microsoft Online extension allows you to do all the usual Office things such as word processing and spreadsheets and can store documents on the Chromebook as well as on the cloud so you can work on documents offline.One limitation of a Chromebook is printing.  A Chromebook is not capable of driving a printer connected to it and does not recognize windows network printers, but it will print though my ""cloud printer"" which directly access the internet and which is set up to receive documents the Chromebook sends to it via the Google cloud print service.To overcome the inability of a Chromebook to run software, you can install Ubuntu, with Chrome and Ubuntu booting concurrently allowing you to switch back and forth by pressing a hot key.  No rebooting required. I tried it on this machine and Ubuntu seem to work, but I didn't test it extensively before restoring the machine to Chrome only.  I am reasonably familiar with Linux, but don't really like to use it.Another way to expand the machine's capability is to convert Android apps to run on the Chromebook.  Google is encouraging developers to do that and some of these converted apps, such as Evernote, are available on the Chrome app store.  There is also a Chrome app (ARC Welder) available that lets you convert Android apps to run on Chromebook.  I tried it on a few apps and was able to convert one of them, but the appearance of the app on the Chromebook left a little to be desired.  Skype does not have a version that runs on Chromebook, but there are instructions on the net for converting the Android Skype app to run on Chromebook.  I tried it but  couldn't get it to work.on this machine.I have read that Andriod conversions and Ubuntu work better on Chromebooks that have Intel processors.  This Chromebook does not have an Intel processor.For me, the best approach to expanding the capability of the Chromebook was to set it up to (sort of) run Windows.  Chrome has a remote desktop app that allows the Chromebook to view and remotely operate a Windows computer using Chrome's ""Remote Desktop"" application.  I set up my old Lenovo x220 Windows laptop  to run remotely, but you could use any windows machine remotely even a laptop with a broken display, or a desktop running without a display.  My X220 laptop has an I3 processor that uses very little power when the display is off, and I just let it run all the time, connected to my router via an ethernet cable.  The X220 won't run with the display turned off unless there is an external monitor connected to it.  But you can fool a laptop into thinking there is an external monitor connected to its VGA port by inserting the leads of a 50-100 Ohm resistor into two pins of the laptop's VGA connector.  One of the pins is the red, green or blue output pin and the other pin is one of the grounds.  You can search the net to find a chart of the pins on  a VGA connector.  With the resistor in place, you can set the graphic options to output only to the phantom VGA monitor.  You should also set the power options so that the laptop does not go to sleep when the lid is closed.  If your windows machine has only an HDMI display port it may be necessary to plug a $15  display emulator dongle into the HDMI output port in order to fool it into thinking an external monitor is connected.  The emulator is available on Amazon.  If your windows machine does not have internal speakers, it may be necessary to connect an earphone into its speaker output port in order for the remote desktop software to forward sound from the windows machine to the Chromebook.Both my X220 and the Chromebook run the free Chrome remote desktop software from the Chrome store.  With a press of a button on the Chromebook, the X220's desktop appears on my Chromebook instead of the Chromebook desktop, and I am able to operate the X220 remotely using the Chromebook keyboard and display.  The response is very good on my local network  When I need to do something I can't do on the Chromebook, I just press the button and use the X220.  I can do this from anywhere in the world.  As a side benefit, a Chrome remote desktop app also allows my Android phone to access the X220 desktop.  .If you do not also have a more fully capable computer, a Chromebook may not serve all your computing needs.  However if you have a windows machine that you can set up for remote desktop, a Chromebook can become a much more useful laptop for not much money.  I find my myself using this $56 Chromebook as my primary

87,"It took me a while to move past the ""Well, it's not really a laptop"" and embrace the Chromebook, but once I did, I found a gorgeous little machine (it looks exactly like a mini Macbook, if that helps) which functions well, is incredibly quick to boot up and shut down, is insanely light weight (I swear my son's iPhone seems heavier than this computer, and serves most of my home-based needs. As others have said, set up is a breeze: just plug in, type in your gmail info, and 10 seconds later you're online with access to all of your Google based accounts. My primary home uses are watching Youtube, reading news sites, watching films on Amazon and Netflix, and responding to emails. If this sounds like you, then snatch this machine up tout de suite! This is the perfect computer to take out of the house (unlike my heavy Lenovo laptop and even my Asus which I fear to touch without scratching). It is solidly built and feels like an iPad sitting on your lap. And don't forget, the price for this can't be beat.The only cons I have are as follows: the keyboard is a bit stripped down, which means that functions you are used to performing on a standard laptop must be done differently on this. For example, spellcheck works not by right-clicking on the misspelled word but by pressing ""Alt"" then left click on the word. Just little things like that, nothing major (so far. Fingers Crossed!). There is no delete key, so backspace must be used to clean  up mistakes. And of course, no disk drive or hard drive (deletion of which made the machine both lighter and less expensive), but there are times I wish I could watch a DVD based film on the Chromebook. However, I have laptops which are designed to perform this function so it wasn't a deal-breaker for me. It is easy to watch Amazon and Netflix films on the Chromebook, and the resolution is amazing. The screen quality, while smaller in size than my other laptops, is much sharper and brighter. The sound quality is average to high average.The possible problems I anticipate concern the OS. I have tried Google doc and while it's decent and probably serves most essay writing needs, I know there may be times in which I simply have to use Word. Microsoft Office and Lotus Office are the only writing software systems I have used, and little things about docs annoy me every time I use it. I worry about compatibility issues between the operating systems, but my son the techie assures me that they will convert without issue. Time will tell. However, the Google apps are free, functional, and accessible for anyone with a device using cloud technology. So if you're a student and just finished your essay on the Chromebook the night before, you can access it on your iPhone and print it out at school with no penalties for lateness (assuming that the teachers allow you to pop to the library). Due to the cost, portability, appearance, and functionality, the Chromebook could be a gamechanger in serving the tech needs of lower to middle income kids who  previously did not have access to home computers. For that alone, Chromebooks should be voted technological advance of the year.One last point: the battery life on this thing is extraordinary compared with its ""big brothers."" A simple one hour charge usually lasts me all day (unless I have insomnia and haunt Youtube all night). In contrast, my Asus lasted 3 hours at most and took about 1.5 hours to fully recharge. I hope this review helps to dispel any fears about whether or not this machine is worth it and what it can do. If your needs are close to mine, it will perform most of them exceptionally well, but you may wish to retain a standard laptop for hard-core document writing and research.

88,"I just got the Samsung Chromebook and have been using it for all of my computer needs. I was part of the Google Ecosystem so using the CB was an easy transition. The keyboard is superb and nice and quiet. The computer is silent which is great. I still have to connect my PC printer via the Chromebook and once that is done this baby will work like a charm.  Not sure why the negative reviews. This CB does everything is it supposed to do. I love the ease of instant on and sleep mode.  The screen clarity is fine and very readable. I will add more as the days go by all of which will be positive as this is a superb, little laptop. Goodnight to all the Chromeheads out there in Chrome world.Update 8/12/13: Great little machine. Love hopping on it as it opens so fast. I get on more to the CB than my old home PC which is so sluggish. I connected my printer from the PC to the CB and it works fine no matter where I am. Connection to the WiFi is fast and I am using the CB more than my cell phone now at home.Update 8/31/13: This CB is superb! I have the Chrome Store app Spotify for music and it works flawlessly. Who needs music on the hard drive anymore? I choose from any artist I want and it plays albums in their entirety or I can make playlists. The keyboard is quiet and easy to type on. The trackpad is smooth as butter and I was never a good trackpad user. I have a mouse handy, however, had really not had to use it much. The CB plays YouTube very nice and I feel the clarity is good and clear. I love knowing I am not saddled to a PC sitting in one room anymore. Can I burn disks for music? No ... just don't care anymore. Don't tell my wife, I think I have a new lover - the Samsung Chromebook!Update 11/7/13: Chromebook working great. I had a little sputter with YouTube which might have been attributed to the WiFi connection. I started using Sound Cloud on the CB and it is nice to have this for music playing. Netflix works like a charm. It is fast starting up and super fast if you put the lid down and re-open.Update 2/18/14: Still loving my SCB. I truly don't have any complaints. I have six tabs open at a time and no lag. Usually, I will close tabs I am not using. I am not sure why some people want to complain about the SCB. It is quiet and does at least 95% on a computer for what most people go on a computer for. Does the Acer 720 have a better processor? Perhaps. I still like the SCB which has no fan and runs as one reviewer said ""quiet as the grave.""Update 5/31/14: Use my Chromebook everyday and works like a charm. I know there are better Chromebooks out there now since I purchased this Samsung model, however, this one does the job and have had no problems since I bought it. Well, I did have one time the screen went blank and I did a reset and has worked great since. I usually have about five to six tabs open and do not notice any slowness.Update 12.14.16: Still using my Chromebook for all daily tasks. Working like new and Chromebook has updated the system many times. Would I buy this model again? At this date, I would not only because there are more Chromebooks with better specs and lower prices today. Still a good laptop for everyday use.

89,"Pros:  Cheap - lightweight - decent number of apps available - Netflix works - Amazon Cloud Player works - runs cool and quiet - reasonable replacement for netbook, tablet, laptop for many functions.  It's kind of like a tablet with a keyboard.  Good screen and speakers.  Starts up virtually instantly, gotta love that.Cons:  Fewer apps than Windows and Android.  (Can't speak about Apple OS.)  Biggest concern for me would be build quality.  Screen bezel is not well secured on the sides.  SD card will not sit flush in it slot which makes it uncomfortable if you have the card installed whilst using device on your lap.  Power connector is quite small and looks fragile.Conclusion:  This device works well as advertised.  I would expect more apps to be available if Google Chrome takes off as an OS.  I also expect there will be a range of such devices in the future that will be both of better and lesser quality (well, couldn't be much less in build quality) in the future and of course prices will be under pressure then.

90,"This is actually my first laptop. My mother got it for me for Christmas(I am using her account to write this), after I was saving up for it for 6 months. I did not figure that mom would get it for me, so I chose the cheapest but best quality laptop I could find. This seemed perfect for me, considering that I usually only use the internet on the family computer. I looked forward to all the features that this computer held. It seemed perfect. Now, after trying it, my first impression is that it is not as good as I imagined it, but for a first laptop, it does not disappoint.  The Chromebook is very small and lightweight, making it easy to carry around. The design is very sleek and modern, with very nice color, if a bit dull. I am considering buying a skin for it, but if not, it is still very nice. The keyboard is amazing. The keys are just far enough away to make it easy to type. There are a few downsides, though. For one thing, there is no caps lock. It is slightly unnerving, since I am used to it being where the search button is now. I am sure I will get used to it after a while. The only other problem is one of my keys, the ""W"", does not work well. It keeps getting stuck. I am pretty sure that is not for all the Chromebooks, though. Other than those problems, the keyboard manages to hold up to it's expectations. I was a bit confused about where the charger hole was. It and the audio jack are very similar looking, but the charger hole is smaller and on the back. After only a little time, the computer started getting warm, but not too terribly. In fact, it is quite nice for the winter. Overall, the design seemed to be nearly as I hoped it would be, just with a couple small problems.  Setup was much simpler than I thought that it would be. You just have to connect to your internet and log into Google. The update took a bit, but that was expected. It was ready within minutes, and I did not have to get help from anyone else (like I usually do, not being very tech savvy). This was very nice. The getting started page that comes up once you finish setting it up was very helpful, and quickly taught me the basics of the Chromebook.  I have not tried out all the apps, but the ones I have tried seem to work well. The camera is very nice, although I wish that you were able to make videos. However, when you save a picture from the camera into the file app, it is unable to open it. Apparently, I need to get an app that can open the picture. I looked online, and am unable to find such app. If you know what app I need, please tell me, so that I can actually open pictures from the camera app. Other apps I used included Google documents, calculator, and scratchpad. All seem to work fine.  Internet has no large problems apart from the inability to use Netflix. Everything seems to work quickly and nicely. Sound and screen are okay, but not amazing. I have seen better, but I have seen way worse. Battery life seems to be nice.  So all in all, my first impression is that it does nicely for a first computer, or maybe as a secondary computer. I will post more as time goes on and I explore more.

For just $250, the benefits make this device 5/5, while there are a few drawbacks I waited a good week or two after getting this to offer a review though, because I hate when people throw their opinion up on something out of the box.Pros:-Secure. No Operating System to infect with viruses, spyware or malware.-Quick. The startup and wake up time is phenominal-Convenient. Uses all your google apps seamlessly.-Stays cool. No moving parts to get hot. Unless you leave it on a blanket, it stays cool.-Cheap.Cons:-Hiccups. Has trouble multitasking music and movies if you switch tabs and decide to check something. An annoyance, really.-Takes some getting used to. It doesn't have all the things a computer has, either. It can be used without Wi-fi, but it's use is severely limited.-Screen: The screen is okay at best. Though, again for 250 this is hardly a con. It works.Overall, if you use this on the go and want a durable, easily replaced and safe to use laptop, this is right up your alley. If you want to play video games, or are especially attached to Microsoft Word or other programs that need Mac or Windows, this isn't for you

93,"Don't expect to be able to run the full edition of Minecraft or high-power image editors unless you're planning some tweaking with the OS. This is a great little computer though. It's powerful for on-the-go writing, research, and calls, as well as sitting at home. But don't replace your home computer unless literally everything you do is on the internet. Personally, I spend most of my time online, but I also need to be able to run programs like GIMP and Inkscape; I'll be installing Arch Linux on this little laptop.The computer isn't what I'm used to at all - my old laptop (rest in peace) had a very shallow keyboard, a 17-inch diagonal screen, a number pad, and actual buttons on the single-touch touch pad. It also weighed upwards of six pounds. It will be strange to get used to a notebook that really doesn't weigh much more than a notebook. But everything seems really well put-together. The screen displays nicely and doesn't take to a glare, the build is sturdy even though it's light, and the battery runs for at least six hours.This computer doesn't as of yet do quite what I'm looking for, and I'll be messing with that; but don't get me wrong, this is a great little machine if you don't need extra software.

It didn't have to be something with high performance with video games, etc, but i didn't want it to be slow either. Thats when i found this chromebook, in my opinion samsung is a good brand, and it runs on Chrome. For those not familiar, chrome OS is web based and you don't have all the traditional programs like on Windows. I love the Chrome OS because it is s simply the laptop boots up very quickly, and the chrome browser is very buttery and smooth. There's no micosoft office (obviously) but google docs does the trick, and it even works offline now. I mostly use a computer/laptop to surf the web anyway, so this is perfect. The only problem i have is the fact that this laptop doesn't run Java. The look of the laptop is great, aside from the ""speedbump"" hinge, thats very visible when the laptop is closed. The keyboard is awesome, it looks like a macbook keyboard, and is very easy to type on. The battery life is amazing, mostly because of the ARM chip, which is used in tablets for the sake of  battery life. The touchpad is nice and big, and i like the gestures that are done with it, making me feel like i do not need to plug a mouse into it. I've had this laptop for a few months now, and I am still loving it, the battery is holding up just fine, and there is no falling apart of the laptop yet, although the case does creak a tiny bit. I would definitely reccomend this product to anybody who's a student or who mostly likes to surf the web.

95,"I debated between a Chromebook and a tablet computer, and ultimately  went with the Chromebook because of the incredible price point and keyboard. I have not been disappointed.About me:I really wanted something that I could use to casually browse the internet and do some light word processing. I'm pretty integrated with the Google ecosystem (gmail, google docs, android phone) and rely on Amazon's Cloud Player for all of my music needs. That said, pretty much everything I do on my computer is web-based.Things I like:-The computer itself is really light and sturdy, and also pretty stylish (a few of my friends thought that it was a small Macbook Air when they first saw it).  It doesn't feel cheap, but it also isn't something that would make me hesitant to throw it on the couch or in my book bag. I'm going to be backpacking within a month and can't wait to bring this along. I don't even think that I'll bring a case.-Battery life is great. I haven't pushed the battery to its limit, but I'll frequently do some work on my computer at Starbucks for a few hours at a time and have never run out of juice or had any need to bring the charger.-Price point. At $250, you can't be the price on this thing.-Noise.  This computer makes no noise whatsoever. It also doesn't heat up, like my previous laptops have.-Slots. There are lots of different cable slots and memory card slots.Ares for improvement:-Sound quality. The speakers on this computer are pretty weak and my music doesn't sound very good unless I plug in some nice headphones.-Performance. There is generally some lag when web pages load, but it's not a big issue for me.My advice to anyone considering a Chromebook is to consider your actual needs. I read a bunch of complaints in the reviews  about how your chromebook becomes pretty much useless if there isn't an internet connection. In my own experience, every computer is pretty useless without the internet nowadays, so it wasn't a determining factor for me. Google Docs and saved files are still accessible whether or not there is an internet connection.Also, contrary to some other reviews, Netflix most definitely works on this computer.

96,"I so wanted to love this device and give it a high rating but there are some issues.  Actually, near as I can tell, one big issue that cost it the 5-star rating it should get.First off, people need to understand what this product is for and its purpose.  It's a new way of imagining the computer experience where everything is online and in the cloud.  This is nothing particularly new, and most people do this already, but Google and the Internet are the apps now instead of MS office and the like.What's good about the Chromebook: the OS (such as it is) is minimalist, sleek and elegant.  It's snappy and efficient and pretty.  If you've ever used Chrome (or, really, any web browser) you'll be right at home here.  It (logically) integrates with Google services - which is great for me as a grad student, as I use Google Drive extensively for collaboration with students, fellow grad students and my academic adviser.This is not to say the software is perfect or free from bugs, but bugs happen and I'm pretty forgiving of them.Most of the hardware is good, too.  The Exynos processor is just fine for most activities and it boots extremely quickly.  the keyboard is great and the web-centered keys are great.  The plastic body won't win any awards for value, but it feels well-put-together.  The battery is a workhorse.  And it's so light and thin it fits well in my bag.The big problem, however, is the screen.  And there are two problems with it.  I don't know yet if it's a problem with drivers for graphics card or lack of optimization for the ARM architecture (if so, here's hoping Google gets that ironed out ASAP).The first problem is ghosting or screen artifacts.  You can see this if you drag a window across the screen or scroll text.  Ghost lines of text streaking across the screen move with the text on the wallpaper.The other problem, probably related to the first, is flickering when the cursor moves at all.  Basically, any gradient loses most of the intermediate colors.  This is less obvious with small gradients on a website for example.  It's more of a problem if you use certain colors of wallpaper and the whole wallpaper has a seizure when the mouse moves across the screen.  I don't know if this is a defect in my unit or if it's a normal thing that's one of the corners Samsung cut for this laptop.  Still, it's irritating.The bottom line is it's a great concept almost well-executed.  If it weren't for the screen, it would get a perfect score in my opinion.  Maybe the next generation will work that out.  Or maybe a different unit will not have the issue at all.

97,"From buying this in 2013, this Chromebook has by far, exceeded my expectations. I am a student, so this review is just based solely on my experience with it.Pros-Lightweight, I take this with me literally everywhere. Its similar to the Apple air laptop, just a bit heavier-Great Battery life, I can go days-sometimes a week- without having to charge my battery. And when I do, the battery charges remarkably fast. Its so rapid, its kind of scary lol-Durable. I have dropped this more than 100x, and it has not suffered any damage whatsoever for being a lighter laptop. Minor knicks, but nothing that impacted the functioning and productivity.Cons-NOT BEING ABLE TO PRINT. This major downside is quite annoying at times-""  "" DOWNLOAD programs. This is also a major downside. Majority of the programs that are available on other computers are not there for Chromebook users. This seriously needs to be addressed. I know it is a laptop powered mainly on google and its system, but there has to be a way to make certain programs accessible.-Webcam quality could be better. Its not an extreme, but I feel the updated versions have better cameras- This may not be an issue that many people are aware of, but google stores an excessive amount of our information. The generic settings allow google to obtain a lot of the users data, and the only way to change that is by setting it up differently on the settings. This should be mentioned to anyone using google products.Overall, while the Chromebook is not perfect, it compensates in many other areas for the lack

98,"The price is what first enticed me. I got this when it was on sale for $199. For a laptop? Can't be beat. I am a heavy Apple user. I have a 13"" MacBook Pro, a iPhone 5, an iPad 3 and an Apple TV. Needless to say, I love Apple products, but I needed a machine for work (I'm a teacher) and this fit the bill perfectly. And over the past week since I've owned it, I've actually been using it more than my MacBook Pro (can't believe it!)It's thin, light and easy to use. Of course you're not buying this thinking it does everything a Mac or a PC can do, because everything is web-based and in the cloud. Basically if you can't do it on the internet, then you're limited. However, like MOST people, I do simple word processing (use Google docs) and internet surfing. For work, I answer e-mails, take attendance and input student grades.If you're a heavy photo/video editor, gamer or a software developer or something, then this can't be your only computer. However, for everyday tasks, it's awesome.LOVES:* Fast, light and easy to use* Only $199 (I caught it on sale)* I can access ALL my iTunes music using Google Play Music (from my iPad & iPhone too, huge plus!)* Amazon Instant Video & Netflix works great* Printing is easy with a wireless printer.The things I don't love about it are all things I knew before I bought it and I can still do from my MacBook. I can even use Java apps or other things I can't do on the Chromebook by using Remote Desktop to access my MacBook. That basically solves all those problems.I would buy this again in a second. As long as you have your expectations adjusted and know exactly what you're buying, this machine is great.

99,"Though I have used computers and Laptops for years I actually know very little about them and have a great deal of difficulty as they become advanced. I have simple needs and this little computer is perfect. At this point the Chromebook is our 2nd computer, however as  Google comes up with more improved user friendly models that print and so on...easier, then I think we'll eventually keep Chromebook as our only home computer. I have to admit, at first, I wasn't sure I liked it. It seemed awkward to use, especially the mouse. I'm not a patient person. However now, I zip around and dread getting on my husband's brand new laptop.  I buy and will be selling on Ebay. (I haven't looked into downloading pictures yet- I may use my husband's for that task until I learn to use the cloud.) I have chronic migraines. Consequently, looking at a computer screens is painful and more so now due to the new and awful back lighting . However, this little guy has been a true gift. I can spend 3 to 4 times longer on it before feeling any pain. Its amazing. On a typical laptop I feel pain the moment I turn it on. ( PS: to all you back light sufferers, try covering your screen with car window tint paper. I like the self adhesive kind.) On the Chromebook I can also darken the screen completely. Something I have only found in Macs. Additionally, I need larger font size when I read and I can adjust the font size even though the computer screen is small.  Another great feature, and don't laugh, that my husband and I have found useful is the Power Wash. I've used it twice this last week. The last time I had to use Power Wash I put ""Google"" in the trash. Well Power Wash restored my computer to brand new and I'm off running around the internet on my vision friendly computer. Really love it now. I look forward to improvements but not great advancements. I want this little guy to stay simple.

100,"I ordered the Chromebook so that I would have an easy device to take with me as I travel for graduate school and attempt to stay connected with work. I currently have a 17.1"" laptop that I had been using but the weight and size made traveling and using it annoying. While sitting in a meeting I talked with somebody who was using a Chromebook and thought that this might be my solution. I had tried an ipad and other tablets but the onscreen keyboard and/or using a keyboard accessory was not a perfect solution because writing papers and taking notes required too many steps (plug in keybaord, switching between apps while multi-tasking between research/ writing, and finding a place to store my work that would be accessible by my PC/Laptop later). I have owned the Chromebook for about 3 weeks now and can say that this was the BEST solution for my situation, not perfect but best.Why it worked for me:- Instant on: The Chromebook is ready to run and go right away (like a tablet)- Good keyboard: Its keyboard is sufficient and easy to use (like a PC)- No distractions: I am not distracted by updating or unnecessary tasks because this is almost completely a cloud experience- Compact and light: Easily fits in my bag without. No need to buy a special bag to carry this around with you.- Great battery life: I sit in class on weekends for 6 hours or more, when fully charged my chromebook has lasted.- Easy to use: Chrome OS is simple- Connected: Chrome OS connects really well with my laptop and work PCThings I didn't like:- Its painted, I pull this in and out of my bag because of that the outside of the Chromebook has ugly scratches. I am not a fan of adding cases to my devices to protect their finish.- The screen is good, but I would have like something a bit brighter.Other things to know:- if you dont have wifi available or a hotspot you may be limited with what you can do. Google docs and such are available offline but work best when you are connected.- This is a SECONDARY device. This is not a replacement for your PC or laptop, but rather a way to become more mobile. IF you are considering this for your primary then you should expect to work mostly in cloud storage and know that certain things like gaming, photoshoping, etc can be done but not as easily or well done on a PC.- The price is great! I have lost devices before due to theft, damage, and disorganization. Although I would not throw $250 away in the trash, I am not as worried about this device as I would have been if I has bought a new laptop like a Macbook Air or an expensive tablet.

101,"I've been researching what to buy after my current laptop (7yrs old) needs replacing. I was completely confused and overwhelmed by the choices. I saw a banner ad on Google's website and thought I should investigate. I was glad I did since I hadn't heard of Chromebooks before. There were 3 or 4 brands with varying prices on the resulting page I was sent to and after researching the features, prices, processors, etc. I decided on the Samsung Chromebook with Wi-Fi. My main reason was the Samsung processor had excellent reviews for speed and reliability. I also like Samsung's reputation in the electronics arena.I opted not to get the 3G feature, which is upgradeable as there is a SIM card slot. The 100GB of cloud storage on the Google server is another great bonus. Since I don't do gaming and I don't save music to my phone or computers, I'll have a hard time using it all in that timeframe.The computer boots up in a matter of seconds, is quiet (SS hard drive), has a battery that really does last for several hours, the display is crystal clear, and the sound is great. As I mentioned, I don't do gaming and have read that this Chromebook is probably not for that use. There are plenty of other options in that regard.I have my Android phone, my laptop and my Chromebook all using Google Chrome and all are synched, making life using multiple gadgets much simpler. I'm extremely pleased with this Chromebook and feel like I should have bought another one to save for the future!

102,"It serves most of it purposes well.  I browse and surf and twitter and Facebook on this thing, and watch Netflix and youtube, as well.The graphics aren't the best, but they're good enough if you simply want to watch things and aren't too worried about high-definition and so on.The sound isn't the best, so get yourself a decent pair of speakers.Also, the apps are limited.  I really miss Microsoft paint.  App replacements for it are too complicated.That's the other thing. You really have to know your way around apps. ESPECIALLY if you plan on using this while offline.There are plenty that you can use for word processing and the like, if you need to do that.The biggest thing I love about this machine is FINALLY NO VIRUSES or VIRUS UPDATES.  Because it's an obscure OS (operating system) that is discreetly self-updating, I have never had a problem with any kind of malware, viruses, or weird things slowing down the operation.On the flipside, there are also many software programs you can't download and use because they aren't compatible with the OS. You just have to hope there is a comparable app.Again, it's perfect for my needs, but if you want to use CD-Rom or use certain certain software, you can forget it.OH!!! One more thing.Storage IS NOT a problem because of Cloud.Switch to online cloud storage and it is MUCH more convienant for you and your machine.  Access it securely anywhere and anytime.

103,"I am absolutely in LOVE with this item.  When I had a laptop I felt like I did not use most of the features as most of what I tend to do I do on websites with a few documents here or there.  I had a netbook but it was slower than slow.  I got rid of my laptop and netbook for a Kindle Fire HD with Blue Tooth keyboard but the keyboard was always too glitchy and trying to do any typing of substance even with that keyboard was too tedious for me.  This Chromebook is the perfect thing for someone looking for a smallish laptop to do emails, facebook, blogs, documents, you tube, web browsing and that sort of thing on.  It is light weight, the keyboard is awesome with each key spaced out nicely, and the best part is that it has no fan so it is quiet and does not get your lap warm.  I can type just as fast on this as any regular keyboard, which is fast!  It is super simple to set up and get started.  I love that for each of my gmail accounts I can have a separate user on this device so everything is customized differently.  I could not be happier with this and I am so glad I bought it.

104,"I was not impressed by the initial Chromebooks. I simply couldn't justify to myself paying that much for what amounted to a seriously crippled laptop only marginally less expensive than a low-end real thing. Now this Chromebook came and it changed everything because of its significantly lower price and a the clear improvement in quality, features and performance.I've only used mine for a few days now but I can tell already that it's a keeper.THE BIG PLUSES- It's affordable. Big time. You simply can't beat the price for anything decent 'laptop-like'. Yes, you could get a Nexus 7 for about the same price, or a Kindle but...- Screen size. Related to the above. There's a lot more square inches of screen on the Chromebook. Yes, much lower pixel density when compared to current tablets but...- Keyboard. Try to write a few dozen emails or THIS review (I'm writing it now) on a tablet. Not a pleasant undertaking. Sure, keyboards come with most laptops but...- Light as a feather. Well, 2 pounds is not exactly feather-weight but you'd be spending a lot more for a decent laptop.- No fans, no moving parts, not much heat.- Safe. As in ""it doesn't matter if your Chromebook gets stolen, shatters into a thousand little pieces or melts"" for as long as your data goes to the cloud. All you need is a new one - hopefully it was under warranty when the accident happened - or you can get to your data from a friend's Chromebook or access it through whatever it takes to get to your storage area in the 'cloud'.- Quality stuff. It really is. The Keyboard compares favorably to the the ones you'd normally pair with a tablet and even to MacBook's.- Ports. Not all laptops and tablets come with HDMI ports and even fewer have USB 3.0.- 100GB of free storage on Google's cloud forever. Well... sort of. Whatever you place there for the first 2 years stays there forever but you'll have to pay for additional storage after 2 years.I've been using computers and related gadgets since... I can remember and not many triggered a 'wow' reaction from me but this is one of them. For background, we have probably 3 dozen 'things' on our home Wi-Fi network at this time: a desktop, media servers, a few laptops, more tablets than I can count, smart phones, game consoles (both large and portable), Internet radios, receivers... you name it, all eager to serve our many work and entertainment needs (large family) but I can see how I won't be this Chromebook's only user for more than one reason.- Larger screen than a tablet's makes for a better video watching experience.- Attached keyboard makes in the preferred choice when emailing or text-chatting.- Quick boot time (5 seconds?) makes it always available when needed, unlike laptops, desktops.- Connectivity and 'ports' allow for easy expansion. My favorite is pairing with some decent Bluetooth speakers when watching a movie.THE MAJOR MINUSESOf course, not everything is perfect. Nothing ever is.There are some reasons to be concerned, mainly having to do with the availability of your data and its safety. It really comes down to 'do you trust Google with your data?' and to 'do you trust Google to always be there to provide you access to your data?'. My take on this is: do NOT store anything on anyone's cloud that you wouldn't share with a stranger and you wouldn't care much if you lost it. I always keep my personal and confidential data backed up more than once and on devices that can't be easily accessed by 'everyone'. My experience with Gmail is that Google's cloud is quite reliable for keeping casual information and I have no intention of storing anything other than casual content on Google's cloud in the future unless I find some perfect encryption scheme.The other issue is the availability of 'apps'. Google is in full control of what you can run on your Chromebook. If Google decides that you may not run Netflix tomorrow, Netflix is gone. And it's unlikely that you'll ever see Microsoft Office at Google's store. So, it all comes down to how happy you are with what Google offers you today and how confident you are that you are going to be happy with Google one year from now. But, to me, at this price, this is not big deal.I LOVE ITWhich explains my 5 star rating. I know, love needs not be explained or justified but, since I have a pretty good idea why I love this Chromebook, here it is. The price makes up for most of it, then it's the near-instant availability, the near-worry free availability of the apps expect to use most with it: entertainment, emails, text and video chats and the reasonably well engineered body that's light, comes with a decent display, good keyboard, most essential expansion ports.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! <<

105,"If you like your tablet, but miss the efficacy of a keyboard, and the CPU power to really move quickly from app to app, then the Chromebook is for you.It is way cheaper than the current range of 10"" tablets, even cheaper than the wifi only models of tables.  Way cheaper than the iPad.  I got my Chromebook for a fraction of the retain cost of $400 bucks.  Which is still cheaper than most 10"" tablets.This machine, however, is not wifi only.  It has built in 3G antenna and already has a DSN, so all you need to do is call up Verizon and add it to your plan.  I added mine to my Share Everything plan, and it only costs me $10 a month.  I can now surf while near Wifi and surf away as well.  The machine also comes with a SIM slot if you should go overseas and want to purchase a prepaid SIM card.The machine is almost entirely cloud based.The only thing I don't like is that, despite being a Linux derivative OS, they don't let you install Linux tools or even access a Bash shell.  I think the machine could be so much more popular and powerful if they allowed people to mess around with a bit.The ChromeOS is functional, but is essentially a shell for the Chrome browser.  You already have all the experience with the OS simply by using your Chrome browser on any machine you current own.The thing that makes this machine so compelling is the combination of mobility, basic functionality, weight, battery efficiency, and most importantly inexpensive.I wish I had purchased this a year ago, I could have saved myself a small fortune when I purchased my Lenovo X1 Carbon.  It costs me 10x as much to make my X1 Carbon boot as quickly as the Chromebook does, and they weight about the same.  The only thing my X1 has going for it is screen size, in all other respects they are pretty comparable; especially when you consider that my X1 is running Linux.

It's small and light enough to put on top of a small pillow and do email or play games while lying down. For those of you who don't know what a Chromebook is, it is basically a browser machine, plus Google's cloud (Google Drive) , Docs, spreadsheet, music, photo editor, etc. If you want a small laptop (11.6"" non-touch screen) and don't need things like MS Office, this machine will do the trick, although there is a really surprising amount of work you can do just using the programs, apps, and extensions Google has for free. I would never use this as a primary computer, but I believe at least 90% of users could get along with this fine as a portable, something to use on a trip, or, like my wife, as a machine to check email, news, read books and such at the breakfast table. I can no longer get her attention....Incidentally, Google has just introduced a new music service that is an absolute knockout. You will need to load your music into the cloud, but I'm using it on various devices and computers, and it is fantastic.

I am a nursing student and needed something lightweight, affordable and able to write papers on and most importantly, open up all of my documents that the teachers make available online. I did a lot of research when it came to buying this and thanks to the reviews I was able to make an excellent decision. Here are a few of the key things that I needed this to do in order to make a smart purchase from a student's perspective:1) Affordable! After looking at all other laptops, this was seemed to give me the most bang for my buck.2) Lightweight - This is only 2.4lbs which is essential when you are walking to and from classes.3) Ability to write papers - although this is unable to have Microsoft Word installed on it, I have available Google Docs which is just as good, in my opinion, as Microsoft Word. A spreadsheet app is also installed and accessible on this as well.4) Opening up required information - I was nervous at first, knowing that I couldn't install Microsoft Word, if I would be able to open up documents that were in that format. After reading a previous review, I saw that I could still open them up and after trying it out for myself... is TRUE! I am able to open up Word Docs as well as Powerpoints.5) Keyboard - I am typing this review with this right now and I have to say, the keyboard is great. Everything is spaced adequately and offers a great typing experience. I type very fast and it hasn't slowed me down.6) Battery life - I have read that the battery on this can last up to 8 hours which is great!As for some cons - Although I do not watch movies online, I did check it out using my Amazon Prime account and did see that the picture quality is not all that great. But considering what I am primarily using this for, it does not impact how I rate the Samsung Chromebook.I have yet to test out to see if my printer will work with this. I have a regular printer that plugs into the computer and also a wifi one. Will see what happens!All in all, this was an amazing purchase and I am so happy that I bought it. I could not be any happier. For students who are looking for something affordable, lightweight and able to do school work on, this is a great buy. I am in LOVE WITH THIS! I hope this review helps anyone who is comparing their options.**UPDATE**So I tried to get my printer to work and unfortunately it would not. And what sucks as well, I do not have another computer that I can manage my printers from. This is a very big disappointment. Apparently you have to sign into your Google account from another computer that is already registered to the printer you are going to use and then manage/add printers from there. From what I read, I don't see any other way around this. Really kind of disappointed with the printing situation :(. Because of this I dropped my rating from a 5 to a 4.

For me, it's just so much easier to use with the full sized keyboard.  I guess that's the important thing to note.  It has replaced my tablet but not my PC.  I still need it to create Microsoft Word, Power Point, and Excel documents (although once created, one can save them to Google's cloud and then further modify them).  I can't synch my iTunes account (although there are USB ports to charge it).  So it's important to note that it does have its limitations.  You can't play your PC games.  In fact you probably can't run much / if any of the software you are running on your PC.This Chromebook has built in speakers, a headphone port, USB ports, a Video out port, a VGA camera, ability to see movies in high def, and a six to eight hour battery life because of the solid state drive.

As a grad student, I use my laptop constantly for writing papers and doing research, so I really needed a reliable computer.  I also do not have $1,500 to shell out on a new Macbook at the last minute.  After checking out other cheap laptops (including touchscreens with Windows 8), as well as notebooks and this computer, I couldn't deny the fact that the Samsung Chromebook got consistently good reviews while laptops more than twice its price were getting pretty crappy reviews.  Since I couldn't really afford anything, I got the Chromebook on a whim about a week ago.  Tonight I was forced to learn how to use it quickly after my Macbook died and I lost the paper I was working on.  I found an emailed version, uploaded it into Google Docs, hooked up the Chromebook to my WiFi printer (Epson Workforce 645), and I am very pleased.  The brightness and quality of display, as well as the included apps had me pleasantly delighted.  The Chrome store is also pretty fun to look through, and has many apps that I already use on my Macbook (incl. Dropbox, which has all my school docs).  It plays video well so far, and apparently is also capable of sharing remote desktop to another computer, and uploading iTunes libraries into its native music player.  It also does look like a cute little Mac Air (clean lines, though extremely cheap).  I was hesitant about whether I would catch on to using this, but I'm starting to really like it so far.  I was very wary of whether this could really allow me to type papers and print, but so far everything works.  Let's see how it holds up to heavier use.

There is virtually no lag whatsoever when I open it from ""sleep"".  The trackpad is quite sensitive and feels well built.  When I ordered the Chromebook, I was intending on purchasing a small wired or wireless mouse to go with it as I've never really been a fan of trackpads.  This changed with the Chromebook.  With very minimal effort, I am able to browse various websites, save pictures and files quite easily, and scroll up and down lengthy webpages.  I transferred several mp4 movies to a SD card and they play without flaw on this device.  This very affordable Samsung laptop provides me with an excellent tool for accomplishing 99% of what I need a laptop for.  I've used it for several weeks now and have never experienced a ""lock-up"" requiring a reboot, nor have I experienced any sluggishness.  Extremely pleased with this purchase.  Well done Samsung for a well designed device and Google for the insight in creating this concept!_Update 8-9-2013Had an incident the other day which gave me reason to be concerned.  I charged the Chromebook overnight and took it to work.  When I first used it, no problem.  Put it in ""sleep"" mode and went back to work.When I opened it up an hour later, the device was shut off completely.  Would not come on at all despite all resetting efforts.Took it home and plugged it in and viola!  Came on immediately.  Showed that it still had 94% charge remaining.  I have no idea why it would not come on at work but when plugged in at home it came right on.I still love my Chromebook, just do some research online (owners forums) first, and make an informed purchasing decision.  Would I buy another Chromebook after experiencing this one-time incident?  Yes, but I would probably wait for at least a year to make sure that Samsung (or Google) has worked out any ""bugs"" in the hardware/software.Update 12-22-2014Had the Chromebook now well over a year and I am still very pleased with it.  As stated earlier, the SD card reader stopped working but otherwise it still performs admirably well.  Very solid device.

111,"I have read the other reviews and the product reviews on other sites.  I don't think they understand the Chromebook.The Samsung Chromebook is a great little computer.  It is lightweight, and it is tough.  The Chrome OS currently does everything I want.  If you have good Internet access, it leverages that into remarkable capabilities and blazing speed.  When you don't have Internet access, it behaves like any old dull computer.  It still does word processing, spreadsheets, and presentations and stores them locally.  There is no disk drive to fragment or to fail.Because the Chrome OS really lives on the Web, it is automatically updated without intervention from you.  It is invulnerable to viruses.  So you do not need to have antivirus software slowing you down and emptying your wallet.  It automatically saves all documents as you work.  You cannot fail to save something.  Software updates, both OS and applications, are free and automatic.It is not going to run your Windows or MacOS or Linux software.  So if you run your business on your computer, the Chromebook may not be a good match.  If you live on the Internet, like me, it is perfect.  It costs half as much as an Ipad, and it has a real keyboard.  It boots from ""power off"" to log in in six seconds and to operational in four more.  The case is plastic.  (I do not remember the last laptop I had that had a metal case, but I am not a Mac guy.)  I dropped it on my hardwood floor, and it bounced pretty well.  No harm, no foul.(As a side note, I am a PhD who teaches Information Systems and Software Engineering at a major university.  I have owned computers since the Apple II and portables since the IBM Portable (haha) PC.  Now I still have a Windows PC that runs my weather station at home, and one at the university that sits lonely on my desk.  I love my Chromebook.)

112,"I'll start this review pointing out that this Chromebook had some operating system bugs back when it first arrived in January 2013. Over the first two months and many automatic updates later, I have a smooth operating, 6+ hour battery life, fantastic machine.The gap between Chromebooks and traditional mac/pc's is slimmer than many people make it out to be. Yes this machine cannot do much offline aside from watching previously downloaded video on the 15 gb drive or using the google editing suite as long as it is installed (docs, presentations, spreadsheets). Comparing what most people use their mac/pc's for when internet is not available, the typical user will have similar if not identical useability.My biggest highlight of this machine is the stability of the Chrome operating system. Malware, viruses, and other problems that bog down pc's (and mac's to a lesser degree) don't do a single blessed thing to performance of my Chromebook. I'll make a guess this is thanks to the unique cloud software setup from Google that keeps viruses at bay, and performance at a high and stable level.For $250, you will not find a comparable computer with performance or parts that can keep up. The 6+ hour battery keeps me up and working (or playing :p) much longer than I had before. This chromebook is a great jumping point as a second computer for the traveling professional, or even a primary machine for the typical internet browsing person.What this is for:- web browsing- word editing (through google docs)- use of web applications- online video up to 720p (1080p works but I notice that the frame rate per second is a little slow for my liking)What this is NOT for:- complex data editing (excel, access, other database software that is not available)- photo editing (again, not isntallable software)- games that require high amounts of RAM and CPU power

113,"I had the original Chromebook that Google sent some people for free under the guise of mystery to see what it was and how it works. This is a new interpretation of that. I am reviewing this for someone who has no idea what a Chromebook is or who it is for.A Chromebook in some ways is similar to a tablet with a made in keyboard. Chromebook has a very small operating system that you can't break, doesn't get viruses and essentially updates itself.  What you get in that simplicity is basically no maintenance-- great for those who know very little about computers, tend to always get infected with spyware, those who may not be tech-savvy, etc. and only need to get online for email, internet browsing, youtube playing-- the normal basics.What you get more than a tablet is a full regular keyboard and touchpad. You get a browser and all of the Google Apps family of ""Microsoft Office equivalents"" of documents, spreadsheet, and others. You get access to the Chrome store for other web-apps. You won't get everything here, but the store is expanding rapidly.What you get less than a PC is that you can't install Windows applications and some offline applications that work without an internet connection. The Chromebook is really the true 'netbook. It expects an internet connection at almost all times to be most useful and enjoyable.Let's not joke: this thing is super cheap. And in many ways looks like an 11.6"" Macbook Air. If you're on an absolute budget and can only afford this Chromebook, it is quite sleek and adequate for the money. That being said if you're a premium hardware snob you'll be disappointed-- the touchpad is not nearly as sensitive as a premium (or Apple) touchpad, it has a hollow cheap-ish click and the keyboard is a bit hollow. That being said, if you are new to computers, don't be bothered by those descriptions: You'll only notice those drawbacks if you've already tasted the sweet nectar of a premium high end laptop that's build from metal.This one is built with plastic and it feels like it was intentionally imaged after the Macbook Air 11.6"" or other Ultrabooks. This is a good thing. The unit is slim in most aspects and is quite visually appealing compared to other Chromebooks. The charger brick is tiny. The charging jack is tiny. The battery life is very good but the horsepower under the hood is light-- don't expect to have 20 tabs open in Chrome and get great performance.This is Chromebook reloaded-- and it's clearly moving in the right direction. They have a concept Chrome operating system and that idea of limited but bulletproof will entice some and turn off others. Either you're in or your not. Once you're in, the appearance and design matter, and that's where this evolution is compared to previous Chromebooks.I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 for the hollow touchpad and hollow keyboard feeling. I also had to return my first one because the device kept locking up. That was a random fluke bad unit and I didn't detract for that because a lifetime of tech purchases has told me that even the best have occasional failures.If you're just looking to touch your toes in the Chromebook, this is my recommended option.

114,"Call me old fashioned, but I hate tablets. I hate the way the screen gets all smudged up, I hate how small they are and above all, I hate having no keyboard. I hate Smartphones for the same reason, no keyboard. I am constantly writing and I need to feel actual keys, or I make a million mistakes.So, for me, this is an ideal solution. The screen is a nice size and the keyboard is standard size, no difference in the feel between this and my Mac.The image quality/screen resolution could be improved..the colors are a bit muted, but you can't beat the price of this little machine, so I almost feel guilty complaining about it.I care for an elderly parent out of state for a week a month and the fact that this little machine is lightweight, means a lot less heavy luggage to drag around with me, plus it is easy to stash away in a bag or tote.Battery life is excellent.  Browser is nice and fast.The track pad is really sensitive so you have to be careful not to click on things you didn't mean to,but it's minor.Also? It's so CUTE!!! Yeah, I said it..I love it's cuteness, all silver and sleek and skinny.Excellent value for the price.

115,"I am a college student currently enrolled in summer courses; one of which is an online course for human anatomy and physiology—therefore, I was in need of a device in order to complete the lab reports, read lectures, etc.I received the laptop, nicely packaged, there were some scuffs here and there, but that honestly did not bother me, since I was more concerned about the actual intrinsic qualities.Before I could even sign into the computer, I notice that many necessary keys did NOT work. Because of that, I was unable to sign in and had to continue as a guest...on my own laptop.The problem never went away, It was strenuous using this product because if I needed to use a certain key, I had to copy and paste the individual letter in order to sign into my email, campus portal, etc.I still have the laptop in my possession a week later and as I try to do an online exam, the laptop glitches in and out, automatically minimizing the screen and it literally would automatically go to the settings and turn my screen brightness to the lowest possible setting, causing the screen to go pitch black. Which was extremely stressful considering that this was repetitively recurring during my exam.

116,"I love my laptops (a beautiful Asus for personal use and a reliable Lenovo for work), and I've been a heavy iPad user since standing in line for the first generation model several years ago.  Between laptop and iPad, I wasn't sure there was much space in the middle for a Chromebook.  But, when I started reading the rave reviews of the next gen Samsung Chromebook, and when the price fell under two hundred and fifty bucks, I decided to give it a try.And I love it!  A huge percentage of my laptop/tablet use is for web browsing and emailing.  The Chromebook is purpose-built for both.  The Chrome browser works just like it does on my laptop, and being able to have multiple browser windows open is a very nice advantage over my iPad.  As you'd expect, the Chromebook works beautifully with gmail, Google Voice, and Google Docs.  I wish it ran Skype, but since I've been using Skype and Google video chat and Hangouts pretty interchangeably over the past year, so I don't really miss having Skpe on the Chromebook.For emails longer than a short paragraph, the Chromebook is hugely more convenient than my iPad.  I've always loved the convenience of the iPad, but responding to emails that required more than a sentence or two was a pain.  In the week I've had the Chromebook, I'd bet my iPad use has dropped by 75%, mostly because I now use the Chromebook as my default email device.I didn't expect to do much if any document creation on the Chromebook, but Google docs works so well that I've found myself using it for short documents (the equivalent of Word docs) and spreadsheets when it's not worth booting up my laptop.  I hadn't used Google Docs before, and was very pleasantly surprised by how easy they are to use.Printing: I have two HP printers at home.  One is a bit over two years old, and the other is about a year old.  Both are new enough to be ePrint compatible.  Configuring the Chromebook to print to these printers took only a minute or two -- less time and work than configuring printers on a laptop.  Printing to either printer from the Chromebook is just like printing from a laptop -- same dialogues and everything.  Slick and simple.Although the Samsung Chromebook will work for anybody, it really comes into its own if you're already embedded in the Google ecosystem.  Gmail, Google docs, Google Voice, Google video chat, etc. are ridiculously easy to use on this Chromebook, as you'd expect.In terms of specs, the Chromebook is noticeably lighter than my ""thin and light"" laptop.  The screen is a bit smaller than I'd like -- comparable to the screen on my Lenovo X200 series business laptop, whereas I prefer a minimum 13"" screen.  But it's a reasonable tradeoff to get a small size, light weight, and great battery life.The battery life has been a real surprise.  I used the Chromebook Thursday night, all day Friday, and Saturday morning on a single battery charge before it shut down.  The shut down was a bit startling (no warning), but because the Chromebook stores settings, and because the docs I was working on are all in the cloud, everything came back exactly as it was once I plugged in and restarted.The Chromebook starts up very quickly, even when doing a complete reboot.  I typically leave it running, and it goes to sleep after a while or when I close the lid.  When I open the lid or swipe the touchpad, it comes back to life in about two seconds.  This is close enough to instant that I never feel like I'm waiting for the computer to start up.  The experience is much closer to using an iPad than a laptop in this regard.And the price is a bargain.  A tablet with a keyboard would cost significantly more.  (Speaking of price, the cost of this product on Amazon goes up and down dramatically because the device is still in very short supply as of Feb 2013 and stocks out regularly.  If you see a price over two fifty, and you're not in a big hurry, wait a week or two and it's likely to fall back to that level.)Bottom line:  I couldn't really see why I'd want a Chromebook in addition to my laptop and tablet, but this device actually fits very nicely into a gap between those products.  My laptop is bigger, bulkier, and power hungry; and my iPad is great, but is limited without an external keyboard (at which point it's clunkier than the Chromebook) and too expensive to upgrade regularly.  The Chromebook has the efficiency, portability, and battery life of an iPad, but with a very nice keyboard at a fraction of the cost.By the way ... a few years ago, I bought a ""netbook"" for many of the same reasons that attracted me to the Chromebook.  But the netbook turned out to be slow (it was Windows based) with a bad keyboard and terrible battery life.  The Samsung isn't like the old netbooks, which were basically ultra-cheap laptops.  Instead, it's a very sleek machine optimized for web browsing, emailing, and Google apps (Google docs, Google video, Google voice, etc.).  In a world that's going to the cloud, I have a feeling that laptops are quickly going to become horse-drawn wagons.

117,"fast shipping, good price.. I only purchased this item to replace the previous one owned, and the very reason I had to replace #1 chromebook, ALSO happened to be broken with #2 chromebook, this one!!! It was a gift for my son, so it sat in a box and the issue was not even identified until after the return date deadline. I was so upset as was my son we didn't even follow up or try to fix the issue a 3rd time as policy trumps politeness in a world of business , more so in such a big online market like e-commerce on Amazon. Business is business, and it ends there if success is the final result hoped for, right guys???? Policy wise, it was passed the return date when problem was identified, so I didn't even take that leap of faith because I am too old to leap anymore! Ha. I DO find it hard to believe that an item being listed as ""fully tested and 100% functional with only light cosmetic wear"" would have such a crippling issue and still go out the door to a customer unnoticed. It is what it is, just totally disheartening for both son and I. Wish i had checked device condition immediately upon receiving it, then i would have had time to fix issue with replacement before he opened gift for his birthday. Lesson learned!

118,"I love my chromebook. For the price its an excellent ultra portable internet computer.  Their advertising says its for everyone and I disagree with that.  To me for certain people this device is as good or better than the most expensive laptops available.  But for some users it may be too limited.  Hardware wise I think the keyboard is very good and full size, much better than I expected.  The touch pad is excellent, and I am not a big fan of using touch pads over a mouse.  The screen is good.  Its a little washed out and dull but its decent.  The screen is very good with glare.  The hardware performance is very good.  A little below a higher end desktop or laptop though.  On most web pages esp if you don't have many tabs open its as good as any higher end computer.  But some pages especially with many tabs open it doesn't perform as well as a higher end computer.  Video play back was very good. I played up to 720p without any problems.  Sometimes when the video first stared there was  a stutter but then it played flawless after that.  With 1080p it stuttered.  Software wise I think its a good system for most people but not for everyone.  I don't think chromebook would be a power users main computer.  I consider myself a power user but for me its a secondary ultra portable computer.  I think its great for people who mostly turn on their computer and just open the brower.  It also does a little more than a regular browser, there is google's cloud office suite google drive.  There are also other apps and addons that can do stuff you expect from a computer.  I think this device nails it for what it is trying to be.  An ultraportable cloud computer.  Its what netbooks should have been.  I think a lot of people buying ipads or windows 8 laptops would actually get value out of this device...but that depends on the users needs.  Can't wait to see next years which will likely be based on Samsungs 8 core processor.  Should clean up the one area I would like to see improvement personally in , performance.

119,"This is not your typical laptop/netbook.  This is a CHROMEBOOK.  This is also not for everyman.  It takes a lot of getting used to especially that you don't have your usual ""desktop"" access.  Nothing can be saved on the physical drive.  Seamless flow with the Chrome Browser and Google Apps.  If you love your Google Apps, you'll love this.  3G is not the fastest internet speed but when in a bind and you need a quick e-mail check or map search or document editing and filing, it does it's job.  Flimsy plastic parts and almost cheap looking and scratches easily.  Chromebook comes with 2-year Verizon 200MB 3G service and 100GB of Google Drive storage.  You can conveniently plug an ethernet adapter if you need fast internet connection especially when watching streaming videos.  HDMI connection is also a nice addition.  Powers up in seconds and very lightweight at just over 2lbs.  I never thought I'd love cloud computing but because Google simplified many computing processes and having a ton of apps to download and use on the chromebook... I was hooked.

120,"This chromebook is excellent, it meets every expectation I had. I remember researching it before I purchased and there were some buyers who speculated about the Arm-based processor. To be honest, the processor is very snappy, and I have yet to see the device boggled down, even with 10 browsing tabs open. I have been told Google had yet to unlock the potential of the Samsung Arm-based processor and as time goes on Google is working on building software to utilize the capability. Perhaps this is why the processor is so snappy at this time, because there has been a considerable amount of time for proper drivers to be designed.The build quality feels great, and it's easy to tell the chromebook was designed to combat minor bumps or knock overs. However, because the casing is plastic I bought an iPearl shell (which was quite affordable) to prevent scratches. The screen quality is average, not mind-blowingly great, but good enough where it never bothered me. I am familiar with all the current operating systems (Mac, Linux, Windows, Chrome) and would have to say I never feel limited in the Chrome OS. I had a windows netbook a couple years back and used it for essentially the same thing (browsing, movies, flash games, online banking, instant messaging). I never used the netbook for intense games or graphic design because it was running an intel atom processor. Although I liked my netbook, it lacked the speed, security, stability, battery life, low price, seamless updates, virus vulnerability, and solid feel/finish that the Samsung Chromebook has. Thank you for making such a great machine Samsung, and thank you for making a such an excellent OS Google! I highly recommend this chromebook for anyone looking in it's price range ($200-$250)

At the moment it would be nice if MATLAB made an effort to make an extension for chrome (seeing as there is one for the ipad/phone already), but that's not really a necessity.I purchased this product because there are times when I just need to do homework, work on papers, read textbooks (pdf formatted), and I was tired of lugging around my old macbook (which has horrible battery life). The battery life on this particular Chromebook is obscene. On day 2, I had it running continuously for 7 straight hours, switching between random web-surfing for breaks and working on a lab report/reading a text. Lets get one thing absolutely clear if you're planning on purchasing this device: it is not a powerful piece of equipment, so don't expect to edit video, or mix your own music or whatever.Anyway, this thing is perfect if you travel often, need to work on things that are easily saved to the cloud, The speakers aren't very good, but the headphone jack is there if you're listening to music. The screen is pretty good and adjusts depending on the ambient light levels, which is more useful than I thought. Netflix and Amazon Prime stream nicely, as does Youtube.

122,"First of all, I'm using the chromebook to type this review. I am sure that there are both good and bad reviews for the Samsung Chromebook. I personally read the other reviews before making this purchase. I find that the negative reviews were for those who do not understand the purpose of this innovating device. Wouldn't everybody use the internet if they had access to a laptop or similar device? I do not play games or do much of anything offline anymore when I'm using a laptop. That is what I do on my desktop. The system does have its limits, but it is perfectly capable of accessing popular websites.Most of the good reviews on this device are true. I love the keyboard, battery life, screen size, and speed compared to an expensive laptop. I have a small budget, so I was thinking about purchasing either a small tablet with a Bluetooth or Wi-Fi keyboard or a device like this. I made the right choice with this purchase because the screen size is big and the system is easy to use compared to a tablet with a separate keyboard of similar price. Plus, I do not want to hassle with putting on a screen protector for a tablet. I will definitely buy another product like this, and hopefully technology will just keep on improving for such wonders!

I did some research online and decided to order the model that would match the type my students will be using. So far I am very pleased with the product. It's not a laptop, so it does have a lot of limitations. You can not store things on a hard drive or install programs to a hard drive like a laptop; however, it is still a very powerful learning tool. It must have Internet connection in order to operate. There are plenty of cloud storages online to store your personal files and data.I have always been an Internet Explorer or Firefox browser fan, but since I started using my Chromebook, I now use the Chrome browser as my main browser. Since you log into Google Chrome with a Google account, any apps installed in the Chrome browser on the Chromebook will be applied to the Chrome browser of a PC. There are thousands of Google apps in the Chrome web store.If you're looking for something to surf the Internet or something to help you or your children learn new content, then the Chromebook will probably meet your expectations. Just make sure you match your needs with it's capabilities.

For the most part it performs the functions of my regular laptop, web browsing, documents etc. It takes some getting used to, trying to figure out how to do the things I normally do. I like the google docs better than ""WORD""  it saves automatically, easy to drag and drop graphics etc. very nice. Chromebook is easy to set up, is lightning fast (unlike my dell) a real time saver. THat in itself is a worthwhile investment. I have more free time because I don't spend half my day waiting for pages to load. THe only issues I have are learning how to do things I do, or figuring out an alternative. For instance, I belong to Neilson homescan, it is a program where you have a handheld scanner that you use to scan all of your purchases, then each week you plug the scanner into your computer to upload to receive points redeemable for merchandise. Chrome does not support this program. I cannot add my Swagbucks toolbar, and I cannot upload pictures to it from my camera. If there is a way I haven't figured it out. Plugging the camera into it does nothing. This is a problem. I ended up having to drag out my dinosaur desktop with windows xp to use for these functions.

I also have a problem with my memory, so it is not easy for me to ""learn"" all the shortcut combinations listed and I have no way to print them out.

I love the size and weight of the Chromebook and with Wi-Fi and camera built in it would be hard not to like it. I also like the fact that is doesn't require a fan so there is no noise when it is running; I can watch TV and type at the same time. I do find that once it is open (I like the screen tilted back because I wear progressive glasses) it has a tendency to want to fall backward, so I end up resting my hands on the bottom, causing myself more problems with the left thumb moving the cursor around. :) All in all I'm happy with it and feel I got a good deal for the price.

129,"It's exactly a netbook, but with a proprietary Google OS. However, it's very light, and the 6.5 hours of battery life is very easy to attain. 2/3 screen brightness and average web browsing will easily get you there (this does not include youtube videos or flash games, which eat battery for breakfast lunch and dinner). If you're very careful, offline, etc, you should hit 9 hours or a bit more. But, really, who types for 9 hours?If you're looking for a desktop replacement, this IS NOT it. If you're looking for a secondary computer for general web use while out and about, this beats the ipad (and tables in general) hands down (in my opinion) because it's much, much more capable. An iPad with a keyboard (my last mobile solution, and it was a nice keyboard) was no match for this Chromebook.Looking for a downside? The screen, while nice enough, uses a very matte surface to reduce glare, which causes it to look a bit dull, and slightly dirty. Otherwise, the obvious downside of it being essentially a browser is apparent. However, for typing, Google Docs now works offline (obviously syncing when you're back online).Overall, I love this device, and at $249, it's a bargain.

Thus, the video quality is acceptable for my use. The speakers are somewhat lacking in a balance of sounds. I haven't taken the time to explore if that is something that can be fixed. But, when I wear my earbuds, the internal sound quality is very nice. I purchased an Amazon basic bag and a hard shell to protect the exterior of the unit. The hard shell is nice as it seems to give the unit a firmer structure.  I find this is a cost effective way to create protection of the unit. I have been able to adjust to the use of the keyboard in a short amount of time. I do not use it to type long documents on. But I think I would find it challenging if I was in a lecture and was using this unit to take notes. There seems to be a lag time when typing. I would recommed this as an accessory device that works well when out and about.

132,"Was in the market for a netbook to replace my Asus and I stumbled across the Chromebook. I have to say that I did not know ro much about them. I own a Kindle, and an Android phone along with 2 IPads so adding another electronic device is really the last thing I need but with the reviews and the price I could not pass this up.I have only had it 5 days but I absolutely love it. I'm definitely still learning all the things it can do but it is my #1 go to computer. Here is a list of pros/cons.- Love the design, very lightweight- great graphics- very fast start up. 6 or 7 seconds-The touch pad is awesome and easy to use. Finally ditched my mouse-Price-Overall a great machineCons-Still trying to figure out how to print to a non cloud printer. I actually did it but not exactly sure how.-Syncing all my Chrome OS devices was a bit tricky. I kept getting a passphrase error but it went away after syncing phone and other devices together.-Webcam is pretty crummy and doesn't work all of the time-No skype. I will try Google talk.Overall I recommend the Chromebook. Well built and the price is right.

I do a lot of comparison shopping online, for hotels mostly, also for clothes.  There is no waiting to close down because the computer is updating, and no virus updates.  That is done in the background while I'm working.It crashed once while I was watching the Phillies online.  I couldn't figure out what to do.  My wife hit the ""esc"" and the ""on"" buttons and the computer was working again and it hasn't happened since.  I asked her how she figured that out?  She said, ""I guessed, and it worked.""My wife got tired of hearing me swear at my last netbook computer because it was SLOW, really slow.  Then it wouldn't start up and I started to use my wife's netbook which isn't as slow as mine was, but it has jumping cursor (It is hard to write a complete sentence without the computer rearranging the words!).  This Samsung Chrome computer is a dream by comparison to the netbooks.  There are tons of apps for free and paid for and I haven't downloaded one.The screen on the Samsung is a wee bit larger than the netbooks, but not so huge that I can't be taking it with me when we travel.

135,"I bought this computer to use for taking online college classes. The speed of the wifi, ease of setup (really, there's essentially no setup), battery life, and price are exceptional. The keyboard is good -- nice satisfying feel, although not on part with a desktop's keyboard. In general I've found the system easy to use, but there are a few exasperating things about Chrome that will pop up now and again and leave me tearing out my hair. For instance: you can't access documents stored on the computer when you're offline (or maybe you can and I haven't figured it out yet). It's also difficult to find documents on the computer, say something that you downloaded. This system is obviously set up to work online, and only online. Google's apps like Sheet and Doc work pretty well, but if you're used to Microsoft you'll find that Google's products are generally awkward and slightly inferior reproductions. They do, however, work for all your basic needs and the free online storage lets me access them at home, work, wherever I can get online. If you can work exclusively online and need to surf the web, write basic documents, and want an inexpensive way to do it, this chromebook is a solid choice -- just not perfect. Lastly, I've been impressed by battery life -- I easily get 4-5 hours while typing or surfing the web.

136,"This laptop is great, especially if you are a heavy user in all things Google. It really forces you to live in the ""cloud"", and once you do you don't want to go back. I now have all my documents, pictures, and music in the included 100 GB of cloud storage and I love it. Everything syncs on all my devices automatically. I don't have to think about what pictures are on each device or having to upload new music to my phone, my tablet, my computers, all separately. Plus you don't have to worry about losing everything to fire or theft. If you get another Chromebook everything is already setup.As for the laptop itself, it's become the device I use the most. The screen won't impress anyone or the plastic body, but it's got a great keyboard, battery life and about as light as my iPad. I actually see this more as a tablet replacement than a desktop one. There are some downside: it's not terribly fast which can be noticeable, of course you're limited to what you can do through a web browser and you mostly need to be online, and for some reason locally saved videos tend to stutter but play fine online. But at this price I have no problem recommending it to anyone especially people who have found their tablets to be very limiting.

Doesn't have that quality ""Mac feel"", but its still sort of resembles Mac Air but at a much MUCH more comfy price...Sleek, thin, light...boots up in a fraction of the time compared to a high end laptop...and when you are done, just shut the lid...Really nice. But again, know what you are buying. Its not a true laptop, or even netbook...... but in some ways its better.Its a perfect travel companion.Sometimes lags a little wit HD streaming video, but it still performs fine. Again, keep in mind the cost and all the benefits, and you wont focus on the negatives.Battery life is GREAT !For those who really just want an online machine and dont mind using the cloud for storage, or better yet don't really need an ultra portable online machine to store pics, music, video etc..then this is an amazing value. Cetainly a netbook killer in my opinion. Reminds me of a tablet, but still keyboard driven and laptop styled, no touch screen.... Doesnt need all the memory or processor power of a true laptop or netbook because of what it is. Its not running a heavy resource hog OS...Do some research and see if you can really need anything more than what this is. It does plenty for my purposes, but it wont replace my ""main"" PC. I wouldn't recommend for the student.VERY HAPPY.

Without spending a fortune on a big time laptop. PLEASE NOTE: If you are looking to do some serious stuff on here and would need to do things off line then this not it. Google does offer somethings off line but I'm still working out how to use that. If you have some basic knowledge or really no knowledge of lap top/net books/notebooks tablets...blah blah blah, you will be just fine with this. I had a Kindle Fire before this and wanted to up grade (love my Fire but didn't want to spend $$$ for a new HD one) and HATE trying to type without a keyboard. I do pretty much everything with this Chromebook. I email, Facebook, Skype (has a built in camera), after some trial and error I figured out how to download music and transferred music from versus places. You Tube ...Crackle....a ton of apps....hmmm there is just some much with this thing and it is just so easy to use.

141,"As a developer, I had read a lot about the Chromebooks and some workarounds to make it more of an option as a development machine.  If it had a better ssh client (or, more properly, an Xserver implementation), it would be perfect to use as a thin client to my dev box.  There are definitely online development platforms that this could work for, but they don't fit into my current workflow.But, that isn't how it is marketed, and for everything else I wanted to do, it has been great.  Having a phablet Galaxy Note, and a couple of other tablets and a laptop I use to remote into my desktop, this is the device I grab to watch Netflix or write emails or have a second screen watching TV.  The startup is quick, the multi-user setup is nice, and the keyboard is surprisingly good (I normally use an ergonomic keyboard, but can type quite well on this one).  And out of all of my devices, this one seems quickest to connect to my WiFi network on waking and has the best throughput.

The small screen takes some getting used to, and it is certainly not something to 'work' with. But it's great for doing most of your web stuff... email, reading, video, music. The sound is very good considering how tiny and light this thing is.I would probably get the larger screen next time, but for now this is the perfect device to leisurely browse the web and check social sites (even shop) while relaxing outside or on the couch. Battery life is very good, startup is very quick, and overall a great experience for those not needing much.It might take a while to get used to the trackpad, and the slightly different key configuration (no buttons for trackpad, no delete or capslock or page up/down for keyboard) but remember what this notebook is for...  simple stuff at a simple price.Why only 4 stars? I just didn't want to say it was the greatest thing in the world. It has it's limitations, AS designed. If you are looking for something that is just for email and browsing, and maybe watching netflix, this thing is great. It might be a great gift for someone you want online, but remember the size of the screen if getting for some older people that refuse to wear glasses. :)

For the price and the quality, it's reliable, fast as heck, and if the kids happen to spill juice on it while streaming movies on an airplane, the cost of replacement is far easier to swallow than the $800 Mac version. I take this laptop everywhere, and its wifi adapter surpasses that of my other $900 multipurpose Samsung laptop. Google really knew what they were doing when they helped develop these chromebooks, and this Samsung version is a godsend. If you want the ""status statement"", by all means, spend the extra several hundred for a Mac chromebook that will deliver the same functionality. However, if you just want a speedy, take-wherever-whenever-for-less-than-$200 kind of laptop, this Samsung version will not disappoint.

I figured at that price I could gamble a little bit.  So far, it's been everything I was expecting.  And I dearly love having a keyboard for those times when I'm surfing the Net and feel the need to talk back,  or get an idea and want to take a quick note. Scratchpad--which comes with the device--is perfect.I did a fair amount of research before purchase and am still amazed by people who clearly don't.  This is a web based device and must have an internet connection to do its basic job.  Yes, it can do a few things offline, but very few.  For me the ability to write off line on both Google Docs and Scratchpad is all the offline I need.It's lightweight, pretty, and I've been amazed at the battery life.  My research led me to believe it was OK but not great.  So far it's been significantly better than I expected.Like any other device--FIRST DECIDE WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.  It's not a laptop.  It's not a tablet.  It's a whole new thing of its own.  For me it works really well.UPDATE 1.7.13:  I continue to be impressed.  Although this machine is Google centric I am required by my company to carry and use an iPhone.  So far I've uploaded all of my iTunes music library to Google Drive so I can listen on Chromebook.  I also use an iPhone app ""JotNot Pro"" to scan and upload documents to Google Drive.  I especially love it for scanning business cards.  Works perfectly. I can hardly wait to find out what other things I can do.

It's small and light enough to carry in a large purse, and the instant start-up and shutdown is amazing. I love being able to flip it open, look up something on the internet, and then shut it down again in seconds. It's essentially made for browsing the web, but I often use it for offline writing using writing apps such as Writebox. It's also very handy in the kitchen for looking up food information and recipes.That said, this is by no means a device you can use as a primary computer. There's little storage space, and of course you can't install games or anything on it (only chrome browser apps). For what it does, I might rate it lower and recommend getting a kindle or tablet instead if it weren't for one thing: the AMAZING keyboard. I do a lot of typing, and this keyboard makes it a pleasure. This is an excellent computer for blogging and writing. Students would probably find it very handy.I am satisfied with my purchase.

I don't do much more than the regular web surfer, so I was very disappointed.I also returned the second machine and purchased the Acer c720 with the 4GB ram...and that makes a huge difference.

This app allows me to operate my desktop at home from wherever I am.  I can update files I need to update.  I can execute any programs that I may need to execute - including Word and Excel.  Can run special programs on my desktop like Fidelity's Active Trader Pro.  Essentially I have my desktop at my side wherever I am.  This makes the Chromebook an outstanding bargain.  Sure, it may run a little slower but I have not found anything I cannot do.  Installing Remote Desktop took just minutes on the Chromebook and on my desktop.  No muss, no fuss.  I would recommend this unit to anyone that wants a convenient, easy to use, economical computer that can do anything any laptop can do as long as you have Remote Desktop installed.  Purchased from Amazon when it was on sale for $219.  At $249 it is still a great deal.  To think I almost purchased an Ipad.  So glad I didn't.  The touchpad is smoother to use than the one I had on my HP laptop although I have added a wireless mouse (Logitech unit that I plugged in and it worked instantly).

Then when it comes back on my wifi is gone and I can't get it to work for a couple days. And of course it's too late now to return it, so I pretty much lost $249. The reason I got this was because my old laptop was just that old, it was running slow and would freeze up. I saw this on Amazon and then in advertisements, saw the price and thought not bad.

I can't speak for later models , technical aspects , pricepoint etc.  It is incredibly inconsistent.  It will work fine for a couple days and then pages take forever to load. Usually once the delay begins I know that the page will not load.  After waiting,  I will get a message that the  ""page will not load""  a phrase/icon  I've come to loathe; ""He's dead Jim"".  I follow the Chromebook instructions on the best way to remedy the problem which is ""reset the chromebook"".  50% of the time that solves the problem.  If that does not work I will log off shut down and restart which seems to work.  Sometimes I just get so frustrated I don't bother trying again and go to my 2008 Dell Desktop which still works great.  I always have full wireless ""bars"" showing good reception and am close to the wireless modem.  It truly is hit or miss.  Hoping others have had a better experience.

I use my N7 for Netflix, Pandora, surfing the web, banking, looking at Google Finance, and email.The N7 is perfectly capable of doing all that. That said, it has some shortcomings.For example, there is an Amazon app for Android, but you can't initiate a return in the app - you have to go to the desktop site to do it.So you load the desktop site on your 7"" screen with no keyboard or mouse, and constantly have to zoom in/click/zoom out/guess where you're typing stuff because the touch keyboard covers half the screen.This is where the Chromebook comes in with its full size screen, full size keyboard and touchpad. It can't install apps like the N7. It's not quite as fast as the Nexus. But everything you can do on the Nexus you can do on the Chromebook equally well. Every app that is on the N7 has a desktop website equivalent.The Chrome does weigh more, but is still small and light enough to go in a backpack. For what I use it for, I don't see a downside.

PgUp & PgDn replaced with Alt up and down.  DEL replaced with ALT backspace.  All very intuitive and easy to use.  ALT mouse pad tap = right mouse button -- took me a long time to get good at double tap before I realized I could do it this much easier way.  Smaller keyboard with fewer bigger keys -- excellent.Other excellent points:- Thin and very light -- easy to carry and use most anywhere- Excellent battery life- Boots so fast, leaving it off really helps the battery life- Clear screen of perfect size and resolution for a small system- Developer mode gives plenty of flexibilityWorst points:- Initially, YouTube wouldn't work but it's fine now.- VPN doesn't work but I moved to SSH tunnels using the Secure Shell App and that works fine.- Screen contrast reduces at low brightness but I'm used to it.- A little flexible mechanically but, again, it's cheap.

I have not yet tried to use the free 100 gigabytes through Google drive but I'm sure I'll use it because the 16 gigabyte hard drive will not hold all of my documents for school. The built-in webcam is grainy but completely fine for my Google Hangout sessions. I think I will be using this more than my mac, especially since it is so portable. I would give this product 5 stars but Google needs to improve on somethings. Please buy into this system so that it will be worthwhile for Google to spend money developing this platform.

It loads up everything within about 7 seconds, and closing it down takes a single second.  It is very different relying on being online for everything, but it is easy and forces you to realize the needless dependence we have on programs like Microsoft Office, etc.I would love to see more programs available as apps through the Chrome Web Store, and until then, I can't get rid of my personal laptop, but for kids it works well.  I also use cloud printing for them which is easy to set up with a newer printer.I do wish Google would allow a 'kids profile' setup for parents to better manage everything and allow them limited access to Google products, but that is certainly not an issue that I have this Samsung Chromebook.  This Chromebook was a tremendous buy.  It was frustrating that Amazon only allowed users to purchase a single one, as I have three children I wanted to give them to.  I was able to purchase another through my wife's account, but we are still trying to find a third.

159,"I am still learning and experimenting with the Chromebook but so far it has been great.I love the less than 8 second boot time and the long battery life.  The solid state drive is excellent.  The processor is fast enough for most things including watching videos.  I use part of the SSD to boost the processing speed.The one thing that I absolutely had to have was the ability to word process offline and to watch movies offline.  I am able to do both.  1. I have to use google docs to write with when offline but that's not that often and I can copy and past into scriptito when I get back online.  2. I put movies onto a SD card and I am able to watch movies anytime.This is perfect for traveling.  Its lightweight, compact, and has a large enough screen to enjoy movies on a plane.  I was also able to take control of my home desktop while I was 2,000 miles away to gain access to files that I needed.  You just have to use the chrome remote app and leave your home desktop on.Gonna try a usb logitech HD webcam next.  Too bad you can't get skype but I can use my cell phone for that.

160,"I purchased the Samsung Chromebook for myself as a holiday gift after my first semester of college. Prior to this device, I was taking notes in a good, old-fashioned notebook, which was fine... I guess. My note taking in class was goodish, but during second semester my note taking was phenomenal. Using Google Drive, I could organize my notes into specific class topics, as well as certain units and class dates. Not only did this benefit me, but it was much easier to email the notes that I took to other classmates who had missed class than it used to be to lend them my notebook and get it back later that week. Taking notes in Google Drive is life changing even if it were only for one thing: the search function. If I'm supposed to study about the Renaissance in Europe, and certain things about Italy are spread out across the semester, I no longer have to page through my notebook and try to find Italy in my notes. All I need to do is type ""Italy"" into the search bar and it automatically shows me all of my documents that have Italy in them. It's incredible for studying.Schooling aside, this computer is amazing for simply browsing the internet. I spend a lot of my time on the internet (probably more than I should,) and this computer handles everything that I need to do in everyday activity. There used to be a problem with the video playback which caused the computer to be severely bogged down while watching YouTube, but it has been resolved as far as I can tell. This is the beauty of the Chromebook, also; the updates for the device are often so that they fix problems promptly, but they are very unobtrusive. I'm looking at you, Windows. There will never be scheduled updates/restarts. When there is an update, all you need to do is restart your Chromebook whenever you feel like it, and the update is applied within about 30 seconds. No more 30+ updates before shutdown. No more waiting 5 minutes for your computer to power up. This little guy is a beast.

161,"Been using this Chromebook for a couple of days now.  Overall it is a nice web browser/computer.The screen is much smaller than I am used to but it does make it easy to transport.  You are limited to what Google Chrome offers in way of software.  I have had some issues getting apps to load and there are many things out there that are not compatible with Google and Chromebooks.For most of my usage, which is just web browsing it makes for a nice laptop.  I mostly do e mail, on line banking, etc.By no means is it a full fledged laptop or computer.  If you need that for your use, this is not what you want.  For my use, I am happy with it.  I do wish it had a slightly larger screen as it is difficult to see the smaller print.  You can adjust your viewing size but it doesn't totally fit the screen if you do. You will have to scroll over  to read.  Some web sites it works fine.

162,"I've been using Google Apps (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Sites, etc.) for the past 2-3 years.  I love this little thing.  Super light & easy to transport.  Turns on instantly when you open it up, no more waiting for the OS to load.  Battery lasts all day.  Simple & elegant.  I borrowed one of the original Samsung Chromebooks from a friend for a few months before ordering one of these for our local House of Prayer.  Since then I've had 2 friends buy one for personal use & my wife purchased one to use as her work computer.  She barely turns on her old desktop.  I'd love to get one for personal use, but haven't pulled the trigger yet.  I've been able to print by setting up Google Cloud Print.  We've had some issues with the HDMI out a bit.  It has originally worked flawlessly, but I think after one of the updates to the OS it would no longer mirror due to a resolution issue.  If I can find an alternative to MS Money, I think I could move exclusively to a Chromebook.

There supposed to be getting netflix supper sometime soon but as of now they have not. That doesnt bother be since i have so many other devices i can get it on that i use my computer for its intended purpose. I have even played a browser game on it and does the job well! battery life is great and awesome for people who blog or need to write a lot for school! Highly recommended for the person on the go.Update: I have been informed that netflix does work on the chromebook now.

164,"I will update this review after more thorough use of the product, but I only bought this because I had read in the reviews that netflix compatibility issues had been resolved and that it was currently possible to stream netflix movies. This is not a possibility. Netflix site pops up with message saying my device is not currently compatible. Any suggestions?UPDATE: This was the most recent update, I did check for system updates and it was up to date. I spent about 30 minutes searching online and tried altering the computer's settings and got netflix to work. I am upset that a fairly savvy 25 year old had to put so much time/thought/effort into making a basic function work, but I am pleased that it is up and running and netflix does indeed work!Now that I am over the netflix frustration, this Chromebook is exceeding my expectations. I am updating my review from 2 stars to 4 at this time. Web browsing is fast and smooth, video playback is without incident, screen resolution is fine, brightness seems the same as other laptops, product feels light and portable without feeling cheap. Really like that there are no fan whirring noises like with traditional laptops and that this doesn't get hot at all. I like to watch movies in bed and leave the laptop on the bed next to me. Traditional laptops overheat, make a lot of noise, and end up shutting down. The Chromebook barely gets warm to the touch!Overall, pretty happy. Will update again to comment on durability, how the speed is doing after a couple of months, etc.My only question to other users...I was told this comes with free in flight wifi for 10 flights. Is this in the written materials that come with the chromebook or are these virtual passes? How do I find/access them?

165,"So I'm a busy college student who who was looking for a laptop that wouldn't cost me a fortune. Being a student, I was looking for something that was easy to throw in my backpack, had a long battery life, and was easy to take notes with (with a word processor or slide presentation). After having the Samsung Chromebook for about a week, I have to say that so far I'm really impressed.Specifically, I've been really impressed with how the Chromebook has performed. I've been carrying it around in my backpack and have used it during all of my lectures. The battery lasts a lot longer than I was expecting, even with the screen set on the highest brightness setting, the battery has lasted the entire school day (around 5-6 hours).Keep in mind that for $230, you have to sacrifice a few things. There is very little internal memory, but with Google Drive and/or a flash drive, this is something that shouldn't be a deal breaker. Also, it does take a little bit of time to get used to the Google operating system if you haven't used it before, but after only a week I already am feeling pretty comfortable with it. I have used Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Calender for a few years now, so the transition was pretty smooth. If you aren't very well acquainted with these Google products, then this product might not be for you since it is powered by these apps.If you are a hardcore gamer, photographer, or are into some other computer-dependent hobby, then be weary of buying a Chromebook since a lot of games/programs that you may want to download might not be compatible with a Chrome Operating system.The take home message: if you consider yourself somewhat tech savvy and don't mind getting used to a new operating system, then get the Samsung Chromebook! I am very happy with my purchase and don't have any regrets!

166,"I bought the Acer 720 for my Ex and the Samsung for myself after setting hers up for Christmas  and liking the chromebook experience. A few differences I see, The Acer has the Usb ports on the side. The Samsung on the back. Since I use the laptopo on my lap the USB Flashdrives in the back of the Samsung tend to hit my knees and bend or pop out. No problems with the Acer side ports. I had to buy a mini Sandisk 32 to leave in the back of the Samsung. So far so good.  Con-You cant easily rename the flash drive after formatting it on a chromebook.""Untitled"" is the new name. The  File explorer is lacking somewhat compared to windows. Maybe there is a third pty app. Another observation:the ACER is HD , Samsung no mention.Battery life on Acer seems longer. Lastly ,The Acer set up quickly on her ATT wifi, I had to call comcast help desk to get the Samsung to work. I had to reboot the Router daily and log in  on the chromebook with the comcast password, The tech changed something on the router he said chromebooks did not like.Works fine now. All in all, I  use my Windows 7 laptop infrequently nowadays.  enjoy the Chromebook experience,,I expect it will only get better.

167,"I've had the chromebook for about three weeks now, so I thought it was about time that I posted my initial impressions since I looked over so many reviews before buying.First I'll describe myself so that readers will have a little context. I'm an adult graduate student who is beginning full-time next year. I'm pretty tech savvy, but probably something of a minimalist by most standards. My needs don't include watching or saving full length feature films or TV shows. I may need to watch shorter videos on YouTube as required for classes. I listen to Pandora sometimes, but it's far from a necessity. So, why do I need out of this computer? I need a word processor. I need the web for research; for me that mostly means searching databases and reading pdf versions of scholarly articles. I take notes faster on a keyboard. While I don't really need it, being portable is a big, big want.I don't play videogames or do facebook.What I like about the ChromebookAs several people have noted, the battery life is better than advertised. It is crazy how long the thing can last after a full charge.The size is amazing for putting in a bookbag or messenger bag. Because the battery is so good, you can just shut it 90% of the time without shutting down and toss it in a bag. Pop it open whenever and you're ready to go. The convenience of the size plus the battery probably makes it worth $250 alone.For what I do, it is plenty fast. It surfs the web, loads pdf documents, loads pages quickly and easily handles all the tabs that I have had open on it. But then again, I don't play Call of Duty, while listening to Pandora, while watching YouTube, while downloading the Lord of the Rings Trilogy … I mostly read and write on it.The mousepad operation is pretty smooth. Two finger scrolling is awesome. It works for reading and so on, but it works for zooming too if you use ctrl + two finger scrolling.Great keyboard for such a small machine. Is it a little tight? Sure. But one of the biggest advantages to this machine is its size. To have a computer that weighs in at under 2.5 pounds, it's worth a little tightness in the keyboard.No moving parts. That might not mean a lot to some people, but I had an old laptop whose hard drive crashed. I'm pretty sure it was an overheating issue. I haven't been a big fan of the cooling system in laptops since. ARM processor + solid state hard drive = no spinning hard drive, no cooling fan= less stuff that can break in cheap electronics. That makes me happy.I have plugged in flash drives, a usb mouse and a usb headset with mic. They all worked fine immediately.The price is unbelievable for this machine; I mean really? $250? If you get an open box version from Amazon or a coupon at Best Buy you're talking $200, new. Unless you want a massive hard drive, I just don't think anything else in the price range can compete.It's basically like a productive Ipad with a keyboard (to me). Someone who knows more about tablets may think I'm a fool, but I've seen bigger fools than me trying to type a paper on the screen of an Ipad. I can write manually faster than that. I thought pretty hard about buying a tablet instead, but after fooling around with a few, I just couldn't figure out what I could do with them other than surf the web or play games. The keyboard on the Chromebook was a big selling point for me.I put Lenux on it, and it works great. (Look it up online.) Mostly I use the word processor, but I was also able to load Java that way. It allowed me to use an interactive “collaborate” function through Blackboard. As far as I know, Blackboard collaborate would not have worked without Linux.What I don't likeGoogle documents is good for taking notes and writing a first draft. If you're a serious student, I wouldn't plan on typing all of my papers solely on Google Docs. It's not on the level. Yet. Tables are the worst in it. You can't see your formating marks. Once documents get really big, it doesn't scroll through them all that well. If you intimate with Word, Google Docs is kind of a joke for something polished. (Like I said above, I put Lenux on mine and LibreOffice does work pretty good.)There's no Java. To me that's only been a problem with Blackboard collaborate, and I was able to circumvent it through installing Linux. Not really a big deal to me.The size. This is in the “what I like” column too. The thing is that its size makes it super portable, but I was recently working on editing a 25 page paper on it, and it was just, unbearable. I had to open it on a bigger computer to work on it. The size is a blessing and a curse. I wouldn't want this to be my only computer for heavy editing (the kind of stuff that involves moving around lots of text ten pages away and switching back forth or looking at two windows a lot or using a split screen).The hard drive space. I don't really need a lot of space, and it still bothers me a little. I got a 32 GB SD card to go with it, but it sticks out of the side a little. It'd be nice to be able to put it all the way in and leave it, but that didn't work out that way. I still wouldn't trade it for a netbook with a spinning hard drive and a fan, but then again, I really don't need more that about 8GB to do what I'm doing with the thing. For a lot of people, hard drive space may be a deal breaker.Sum-UpAll in all, I would definitely buy the Chormebook again. It's portability and battery life alone probably sell it, I mean, combined with the very reasonable price tag. A Macbook air costs how much? At least five times as much, and at least one of the main disadvantages (size) would still apply to the Mac. There are a couple of netbooks in the same price range, but the main advantages I saw there was having Windows and the bigger hard drive. If you don't need the hard drive, that's one down. With Windows, you'll either end up with Windows 7 Starter or Windows 8 neither one is a great option to run on a small computer. Both Chrome OS and Lenux are much less susceptible to viruses. And faster.I think that you really just need to know ahead of time what you're going to use it for, and make sure that it will be able to do what you want it to do. It's not a full-blown laptop, but for what it is, it's better than a laptop. I wouldn't buy it as my kid's only computer and then send them off to the dorm unless I was  trying to build character by encouraging him to use the ample computer labs (available at almost any institution). Not a bad strategy if you're trying to build a little character. It's doable for sure, but just know that for big stuff, they would probably need to use a bigger machine. (Also, don't get me wrong; I typed many pages of the monster paper on the Chromebook. It worked great. Editing was the problem. It was just difficult to move back and forth in a doc that big and to open multiple windows at once or use the split screen.) Besides, you could probably buy one of these, plus a desktop or non-Mac 15” laptop for less than a Mac.Basically, Chromebook’s a pretty sweet deal.

168,"I work on a computer all day at the office, but never felt the need to get one for home. Recently I got wifi and said what the hell, let's get a computer. I thought about what I wanted in a computer and really I wanted to answer all of those questions that suddenly appear in my mind that I usually forget. Now I have knowledge at my fingertips. I wanted to stay connected with family and friends on social media and now I can. (not just during work hours hiding from my boss) And finally I wanted to watch YouTube videos for everything. Songs, lyrics, cats on roombas, how to make stew and sharpen knives. These are all available to me now. The computer has a really easy to use keyboard. It is light because storage is in the cloud. It is small enough to fit on the kitchen counter while cooking, but not too small like a phone. Sure later when I am ready to score a movie or start working on art projects I will upgrade to a Macbook, but for now this thing is great.

I believe the next generation will have a backlit keyboard, which will be a PLUS. However, the screen provides sufficient lighting in dark environments.The touchpad is a little problematic for me; however, I'm retraining my hand placement on the keys so that my right wrist is slightly curved. I do have a mouse and sometimes cover the touchpad with an index card if I am being super productive.I like the way I have access to all Google-related applications with one login, too. I am evaluating this product to recommend to our local community college bookstore for student purchase. For the price, I believe it will serve students better than an iPad and/or laptop.I highly recommend this without reservation.

170,"The Long Version:Let me start this off by saying that I am quickly able to adapt to new technologies, as I am a tech fanatic. If you do not adapt to change well/quickly, your mileage may vary with the Samsung Chromebook.I ordered this particular machine because it is capable of doing all of the things that a beginning college student needs, and for the least amount of money. The things I consider ""needs"" are the ability to take notes, edit documents, create documents, and access online content (yes the Chromebook supports Flash Player).Typical User Experience Summary:My experience with the Chromebook has been quite pleasant after one week of use. I have gotten accustomed to the Internet-based applications, and enjoy them on my college's free Wi-Fi network each day I have class. I take notes with the Scratchpad app in my Math, English, Psychology and History classes and my notes are immediately backed up to Google Drive after any modification to a document. No hassle with the usual File-> Save As that you experience in Windows or Mac OS X. After each edit or addition to a document, the Chromebook will sync and back up any document you are working with and you can just close it when you're finished. While the Chromebook cannot load an install of Microsoft Office for Word, PowerPoint, or Excel, you CAN edit MS Office documents in the free web-based application called Google Docs, which is free to anyone with a Google account (you don't even need a Chromebook to use Google Docs).Technical Information:I usually get 1.5 days of use on a single charge with medium-high brightness settings, and I am very pleased with these results. The internal ARM CPU/GPU combo keeps the laptop running pretty cool, with the occasional warm feeling after extended amounts of use (make note of WARM, not HOT). The display is clear and of good quality at 1366x768 resolution, and the brightness settings are varied enough to suit anyone's preferences with a quick adjustment from the Brightness keys on the top of the keyboard.Short Version:The impressive stuff:-battery life is fantastic, easily 1-1.5 days of life on a single charge if you don't max out the brightness 24/7-boot time is around 5-7 seconds, shut down time about the same if not a little quicker-all of the included FREE Google software runs excellently, quick and easy to pick up in one sitting-most of the Google apps can sync with Android devices should there be an Android version of the application i.e. Chrome Browser, Google Drive, Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Keep, Google Play Music, etc.-can handle quite a few Browser tabs open with little performance drop-laptop runs cool, rarely gets a little warm. Never gets hot to the touch.The (minor) disappointments:-HD video playback in YouTube is just not possible. It is choppy, and will eventually freeze to the point of just audio running. Must play YouTube videos at 360/480p to get a steady and easily viewable stream.-No LED backlighting on the keyboard keys. Just realized how useful a feature like this would be, as I am typing this review in the dark while watching a movie.-the build seems to be very cheap, all plastic. But what can you expect from a $250 laptop.

171,"I purchased this to use primarily for travel because it's so small and light but instead I tend to use it most of the time except at work where I continue to use my laptop. I used to lug my laptop home just about every night but now I don't. I said lug because, even though the laptop is quite portable, it seems like a beast when compared to the chromebook. The only issues I've had were at setup which took awhile mainly because I messed up the account logon but I got it straightened out fairly easily. Since then it has worked fine. I'm still exploring apps but there appear to be plenty of useful ones. It charges quickly and the charge lasts a considerable time. The sound is adequate and fine when externally connected. It is not as sturdy as most laptops so one has to be a little careful with handling. I've read that pressure on the plastic top can crack the screen so I just don't sit anything on it or squeeze it. I don't think for my purposes that it will completely replace my laptop but, for the price, it is a handy and convenient tool and I don't have to lug my laptop around. I'm looking forward to taking on a trip to the Daytona 500 in February to see how it stands up. It will definitely be a lot easier to manage in the airport and on the flight.

173,"The chromebook is exactly what a netbook should have been.  It is basically a cheap device that lets you surf the internet with the convenience of a keyboard....nothing more and nothing less.  I actually prefer this to an ipad or any other tablet for two simple reason.  1) it is half the price of an ipad and 2) it has a physical keyboard.  By no means does the device feel cheap.  I would say you are getting far more quality than $250 worth.  The best way to describe the keyboard would be a that of a macbook air, but slightly cheaper feeling (more plastic).  The trackpad is also very good...better than 3/4 of the ones on current PC's.  I am use to using a mac, so you can change the trackpad to scroll similarly by going to trackpad settings in the chrome browser and choosing ""enable simple scrolling"".All in all this is a fantastic netbook. I would also like to note the apps are kind of useless b.c they are basically just bookmarks to the websites.  Battery life is a solid 7 hours, and the device runs smooth as butter.  The only thing I have noticed that is strange is the trackpad is god awful if you are charging the device and using it.  This may be fixed with an update, but the trackpad becomes very buggy.******updated*******After a little more time with the device, there are a few things I cannot get passed.  I previously mentioned the trackpad acting up when charging, and it seems like that is not the only thing.  The graphics become very glitchy and render the device unusable while charging.  Also, I have started to notice a very annoying flicker while using the browser, which is also a big deal since 100% of the time that is where my time is spent.  There is a strong possibility that my device is defective since I have not seen mention of these problems.  The flicker occurs when I move the mouse around and have chrome open, and it is mostly noticeable at the top of the screen.

174,"I originally purchased my Chromebook for school- however, the day I ordered it, my main PC broke. My initial thoughts were something along the lines of ""How am I going to survive with only the internet,"" and ""How can I live without Skype?!?"" I used Skype for daily communication, so when my PC broke, I was devastated. No matter what my initial thoughts were, I love this Chromebook. Whether using it to speed through essays with it's super-comfortable keyboard, or browsing the web at speeds faster than any of my computers prior, I do not regret my purchase in the least.Compatibility-  For those of you worried about losing your Microsoft Office, don't be. While it does not run it, the Chromebook comes packed with Google Drive, an office suite I find just as capable as MS Office. Everything is stored in the cloud (Which you get 100 gigabytes extra for free in, by the way) by Google, so I feel my data won't get blown away by server errors. For the gamers out there, this does not run ANY programs other than the web browser and its various extensions. However, you can still do a lot with it. (See Productivity)Productivity-  Is it possible to be productive on a Chromebook? In my experience, yes. As a matter of fact, I found myself more productive on a Chromebook, as I had less distractions in all. As I've said, Google Drive comes bundled, along with 100 GB free of cloud storage. It may be a bit more difficult to be productive offline, but this is solved with the 3G model. You are never offline. Verizon offers up 100 MB of free 3G- which is more than enough for me, considering I almost never leave my router.Form Factor-  The Chromebook is light, and slim too. As a student, the last thing I need are more things weighing down my bookbag- and with the Chromebook, I can drop it in my bookbag without worry. It is extremely easy to carry, and I absolutely love the keyboard. It is comfortable, sleek, and due to it's island-style, I make many less typos. Also- I get around 9-12 hours of battery life out of this thing with the brightness set low. That is AMAZING.Conclusion-  If you are a student that only needs the web, go for it. If you are an adult that mainly uses Facebook and checks your bank account- get it. The only demographic I wouldn't recommend it to would be gamers. For the rest of the population, there may be minor drawbacks, but since there is a suitable image editor on the Chromebook, nearly everyone should be fine.The battery life is phenomenal, so it's perfect for people who are always on the go. Overall, a great product.

175,"I have owned my chromebook for less than 1.5 years and my initial opinion was that it was useful for its lightweight portability.  I did run into some inefficiencies being locked into the google sphere when working with some documents and transferring them back to Office, but on balance it was an inexpensive and portable tool.  Recently, and naturally just after the warranty expired, the keyboard has failed.  There is no output on the screen, although the touchpad works.  Sometimes a key press elicits a long run of characters, just to prove the cable is still connected. The onscreen keyboard can be used to input, but remember this is not a touchscreen, so it's a laborious series of touchpad entries to write an email.  I haven't seen anything describing this defect for others, so I'm not clear on the underlying issue.  I did a full reset after the first failure (of 3 to date), but it failed to restore the keyboard function.  I opened the unit to look for a obvious issue (maybe a loose cable) and found nothing, but the keyboard worked after I reassembled the unit.  I repeated this exercise the second time it failed several weeks later.  The keyboard has failed again after only 2 days.  I don't feel like bothering with an external keyboard and it's not expensive enough to invest in a service fix, which might not yield a long term solution, so I'll probably replace it with a more versatile touchscreen laptop, since their are more options now.

177,"I am in love with this laptop. It's tiny & light like the macbook air (though not quite as thin). It's easy to use. It's cheap. It seems quality-made. It starts super-fast. I can run multiple Google accounts easily. Offline work has been going pretty well too. It's exactly what we were looking for in a 2nd laptop for the home. I think the key is--you have to go into this purchase knowing what you're getting and what this is good for. It doesn't have all your Microsoft office apps, nor does it have a lot of storage space on the machine itself (it's all cloud). We still have a Macbook Air for our main computer that we use for images, music, etc. Occasionally, when I've needed to work in Microsoft Excel--it wasn't showing up right on this machine, and I had to use our main laptop. But if you want a nice laptop as a second one in the home --to be able to surf the web on or do some basic writing, editing, etc --and not spend too much? This is perfect.

GOOGLE takes care of that, too.  Just be careful not to open unknown attachments, or visit dubious websites.  But if you do, signing off and shutting down should clear your Chromebook.  Everything is sandboxed for safety.  Battery life is terrific.  I had a laptop, and had to recharge several times per day.  The Chromebook gives me about 7-8 hours between charges.  It is light and easy to move around.  You can either use the touch pad or use a mouse.  Sound quality is very good, too.  It is a pleasure to open the Chromebook, and type in my password and have my start page appear without the usual waiting and waiting.  Between my Chromebook and my Galaxy S3, I have everything covered.  I know there are other Chromebooks on the market from other manufacturers, but I chose the Samsung because I know they make a quality product.

179,"I've been using my chromebook for about a month now, and have had very mixed results. It is responsive, but when it comes to playing any kind of streaming video the hardware limitations become apparent. Netflix compatibility has been ""in progress"" for months now and shows no sign of coming soon. When you use it for web apps, the chromebook really shines (and really, if that's not your primary use you should look elsewhere).After about a week of use, I found that I couldn't wake it up from sleep mode, instead I would have to reset it if it ever went into sleep. Many people online reported that it only happened if they were logged in at the time (which is a pretty serious flaw), and others reported that it was a known bug. I reported the bug myself and received no response after a few weeks, but switching to the beta channel seems to have fixed it. Be forewarned, you are in for a less smooth ride than you'd get from more polished laptops.

180,"I love this Chromebook.  It boots up immediately, it operates as quickly as a tablet, and it isn't as expensive as an iPad -- only about $250.It is also very sturdy; I drop things a lot, and my first one put up with a great deal of abuse.  It's still operative after two years, even though it's missing bits now.There are two drawbacks to this machine.  One is the touch pad -- I never will figure out how to operate it properly, and quit accidentally right-clicking.  The other is the fact that Skype simply doesn't support Chrome OS.  You can use gchat, but your friends have to have an account as well.I just purchased my second Chromebook.  I find that it has a tendency to crash, probably from over-heating.  My other Chromebook never did this.  Mostly the new one seems to have trouble with a particular bit of game software I downloaded.  However, I've never lost any data (everything stores in Cloud, and I can access it all from either computer.)Overall, I have to say that I recommend this machine over any other computer I've ever owned.  The 4 star rating is just because it isn't perfect.  But, then, who is?

181,"Wow.  SO it's a laptop form with the processor of some new cell phones these days.  Loads all of the websites flawlessly.  Keyboard is exceptional almost the same feel as my current mac keyboard.  Battery life is impressive I get about 6 hours with streaming music and surfing together.  The remote desktop app allows me to log into my work computers easily and effectively, so I don't miss that I don't have actual word on this computer.  Google docs still needs some work with the formatting when you go to print.  I wish the spell check worked a little better I can't seem to right click on the misspelled word to fix the mistake.Form is pretty nice really light good build quality for the price.  The monitor is really inexpensive (cheap, doesn't have a wide viewing angle) but for actually doing work and typing it's clear enough.  I also can't believe that this thing streams movies (amazon prime) so well even in hd.  On the surface storage seems small for the computer but there really isn't anything that you actually download so I don't think it will really be a factor.OS is a little unusual but it works just fine.Not bad for a emailing machine, which is just what I bought it for.

182,"This computer is essentially a tablet alternative. I have my larger computer that I use for business but it is pain to lug out and wait for it to load up and whatnot. The Chromebook is super light and is so thin it can sit on top of your magazines on the coffee table. If you need to quickly look something up it's very convenient to simply grab the computer, which loads incredibly fast, and quickly perform a task on the internet. As I said, it's a tablet alternative. It could never be your main computer. Google Docs is a poor substitute for Microsoft Office. Also, although the computer has apps there are  plenty of internet-based programs that are incompatible with it. I use westlaw training videos and they're simply incompatible with the system. Netflix is also incompatible despite the fact that google has an app for Netflix (why?). You hit the ""app"" and it takes you to the website where it tells you that chromebook doesn't support their streaming videos. What else? The audio is absolutely terrible.Okay so there all these problems, but I still gave the product a 4. Why? Nothing beats the convenience of sitting on your couch and just reaching over and grabbing this little thing. You can't beat the speed and it's great for casual browsing and social networking.

183,"I loved this chromebook for the price when I first got it. I've had it for 2 years now-- and it's slowed down considerably. It crashes frequently. I had to return it to Samsung a couple times when the screen went dead. Now somehow the back of it fell off. Regardless, overall it's good quality for the price. It does everything a laptop needs to do-- just online. Everything is app based, which is fine. It has two USB outlets which are great and HDMI outlet which works for me wanting to watch netflix on my TV. Also has an SD card slot for saving items. It also has a built in camera/camcorder which isn't the best quality but is awesome to have. I can't find anything else like this around for the price. Oh there was a couple other netbooks around this same price, but you know how electronics are made cheaply and sold for six times the price it's made anyways.THE BATTERY-- con con con dies right away.

184,"It's well documented that the Samsung Chromebook is NOT a powerful computing device.What it does, however, it does incredibly well. I use if for writing, surfing the web, email and occasionally watching online videos.For videos, the picture is fine but nothing special. The audio is very loud for a ""laptop,"" but also hollow and a bit tinny -- so, also fine but nothing special.If you want a device for consumption of movies, TV shows and music, get an Android tablet or an iPad. If you want to edit video, photos or audio, get a computer.If you want a light, thin, affordable device with a great keyboard and a good battery for just about anything else, the Samsung Chromebook is perfect. I had to make one small modification, because there is a website admin page I use for work, which I occasionally need to use remotely, that requires Firefox Browser for whatever reason. I got directions from Google to side load the  Ubuntu OS, and I use Firefox from there. Every single other thing I use the Chromebook for works flawlessly in the Chrome browser.I describe it as ""elegantly simple."" Updates are automatic, and there really is no operating system to speak of.I purchased mine used for $177.94 on Amazon. It arrived in its original packaging, it came fast (Prime), and with a few very small cosmetic blemishes (as expected), but well worth it for the amazing price.My one and only (minor) complaint with the device is that the letters on the keyboard are lower case, which took some getting used to for me. But the keyboard really is the best I've ever typed on as far as speed and feel. The trackpad is great, although I'm told it's not up to par with the Macbook, which I've never used.If you're on the fence, buy it.EDIT:05/03/14 -- My Samsung Chromebook froze up on me and would only load a blank, white screen. I suspect it may have had something to so with the extra OS (Ubuntu) I installed on the machine, but I don't know. I'm adding this to my review to compliment Samsung's customer service. I called their customer service number, described the issue and everything I'd done to alter the hard drive and within seconds they emailed me a shipping label. I boxed it up and sent it in, and within a week I had it back in full working order. The entire process cost me nothing. The system was wiped, so when I powered it up it was the screen that pops up when first purchasing the device, but that's part of the beauty of a Chromebook. All I needed to do was log in, and the whole thing loaded up exactly as if nothing had happened (minus a few files I had stored on the hard drive, but that is to be expected after a hard reset.)I've owned a handful of Samsung devices in the past, but this was the first time I'd needed a repair. The experience was completely painless from start to finish, and much quicker than I could have expected.One other thing, I won't be re-installing Ubuntu. I've set the ""Chrome Remote Desktop"" application to mirror my PC, and it is a really, really seamless experience, so for the few times I need to use Firefox, I use that app in the Chrome OS. It will work with your PC's audio, too. The recently-released version of ""Chrome Remote"" for Android does not offer audio (from what I can tell, as of 05/03/14).

185,"I bought this chromebook knowing what I was getting in to; small piece of tech so that the early teenage boy can spend hours watching youtube videos and quick facebook chatting, etc.It is a very nice look piece of equipment (of course, they took the aesthetics from Apple!!) My early teen needed something to hold him over because I was tired of him borrowing mom's laptop (which I paid good money for) to play sub-par video games and watching videos. Since I knew this is exactly what he would do with any piece of tech in his hand, I figured I can use one of these to make him feel special at the same time have something a little portable at a decent price and leave mom's laptop alone (win, win and win).It has the macbook look and feel (for a fraction of the price) decent screen resolution and very good battery life.  The cons outweigh the pros by a landslide unfortunately.  These are my personal cons so its up to how the user sees fit, so don't get offended by my review.  Here goes....the thing is slow, the 16gb of soldered, unexpandable memory is a no, it lags tremendously with even short youtube clips where you would have to refresh the page often or reboot even though there is hardly anything loaded on the thing.  It has a hard time reading files form a usb stick even if it is at a recognizable format (videos especially, no matter how many times compressed, re-converted or chromebook friendly the video may be) but the worst part in my book which I really thought was a disappointment...the lack of apps in the chromebook app store by google.  My goodness you would at least think that since these are the same people behind android and the fact that the chromebook is not as powerful as a newer android phone, that google would have a lot of the apps that do not require much processing power to operate.  Such as certain media players that are great with older android phones which are slow. All in all, its not windows, its not OS X, its not android and its not iOS.  Honestly folks for the price I paid, its not bad, but it is a disappointment because for the same price I could have bought a galaxy note and that thing would have done so much more.A side not, google docs isn't as great on this as it is on a web browser.

186,"At this price, the Chromebook finally makes sense!  Here is what I like about it:- Beautiful design!- Responsive and fast boot-up!- Full keyboard makes for an excellent typing experience.  How many tech items exist at this price point allow for a good typing experience?- It performs all claimed functions very well.  It is difficult for me to recall the last time I purchased a tech item that truly did everything it claimed to do well.- Very lightweight!- Reliable!- Good battery life.I feel the Chromebook satisfies the computing needs for 80% of the population.  More computing power would only be needed for hardcore media editing, hardcore gaming, or software development.  Not everyone needs to do those things.I cannot wait until a Chromebook like this comes out with a larger screen and similar price point.  It will be the perfect candidate for my grandparents!It is awesome to have an alternative to Windows and Apple for personal computing.

One had a screen that did not work upon arrival, so that was returned and exchanged through Amazon. We have had them both for just under two years now and BOTH screens are dead. The screens have had glitches for almost a year now before they stopped working altogether; my son had been doing everything on his laptop for many months with it opened at a mere 15 degree angle, which is the only way the screen worked. Who in their right mind would pay even this much for a laptop that is basically rendered unusable within approximately 12-15 months? It really is too bad, because the operating system functioned perfectly the entire time. Very disappointed. Buyer beware.

191,"This is an awesome unit and the price can not be beat. The only thing someone needs to understand is this is not a netbook or notebook - it's a cloud book and Google centric . That said, it's more of a standard OS than something like Android. On that note though, Android is creeping into a space where those lines are getting blurred. We have a ""Transformer"" that using Android and, other than the price for the pad feature, the two are very similar (Android also has a lot more apps obviously).Where Chrome shines is it seems to require fewer resources and be a bit more responsive. From my limited upstanding, the apps are done at a lower level. Chrome is just a windows manager on top of X. This is more of a Googlized Linux distro than Android which has an ""App"" framework that chews up extra resources to process.Chrome is a real winner. I can see where this will start replacing desktops in the businesses. Having fewer apps is actually a plus in a business environment and this might be how Google sees this playing out.

This lightweight speedster is just what the doctor ordered. It runs on a Google operating system that is crazy fast in comparison to the devilish Windows OS she was chained to on her previous computer. The Chromebook is user-friendly too and since she doesn't have the need for heavy apps like Creative Suite or even Microsoft Office (with the improvement of Google Docs), she has everything she needs in this sleek pinnacle of free market innovation.This computer is clearly an example of the future in computing with its lightweight, cloud-centric model.

We purchased one based on an IT co-worker who is ga-ga over these things.  I have to say, there are many things to love about the Chromebook:1)Speed--this thing is crazy-fast, from start-up to shut-down and everything in-between, you are hard-pressed to find anything that slows the load time on this thing.2)No defragging, anti-virus updates, etc.  Because Google regularly sends those updates when you log in and because there is no hard drive, those things become irrelevant.3)Google Support structure--once you get used to all of the Google applications and options, you'll realize all of the possibilities...however, as a Windows user, that has taken some time and adjustment for me.4)Price--at half the price of a computer, it will be twice as convenient for most usersDrawbacks:1)Very little that you can actually load onto the system's hard drive--this machine is meant to run everything online via Google in a cloud structure...there is very little room, or even capability, to download applications onto your hard drive.2)Lack of printer function...Unless you have a newer printer that specifically has Google print capability, this is an exercise in frustration.  I tried the setup per Google and it hasn't worked yet.  Basically what I have to do is go to another computer, log into the Google account, and then print from there.  It is a bit of a hassle.These two things are the only reasons I can't give it a '5', but it is an excellent machine for web browsing, email, and light to moderate document creation.

It is perfect for web, email, Google docs, Google hangouts, chat, etc.  You can only install apps from the Chrome App Store so don't expect to use MS Word or Excel but you can use the free Google docs equivalents that offer almost all the same functionality.  It is limited when you use it offline but the available apps for offline use are increasing.  I've switched to using this thing on a daily basis.  It still can't replace my heavy duty desktop for things like photo editing or encoding videos but it does 90% of the things I use daily better than Windows 8 or Mac OS (I also have a MacBook Air and Toshiba Portege which mostly collect dust now).

In many respects it's similar to an Android device, but here again it outperforms your typical Android tablet by an order of magnitude.  The two ways it's most obviously faster is in booting up (turning on) and doing web searches.  She's tried all her usual things with it, paying bills, uploading photos, typing emails; all with good to excellent results.Limitations:1.  Chrome reassigns the Caps Lock key to Search.  This can cause confusion if you're used to typing stuff in all uppercase.2.  The OS is so similar to Android one would expect it to have a touch screen, but the Samsung does not.  You have to go to a much more expensive unit to get this feature.  This causes frustration, especially if you are a long-time Android user.3.  GPS seems to work when at home hooked to her families WiFi, but once she's on the road it goes kablooie.  This is also a frustration to long-time Android users.4.  The touch pad is hard to get used to.  There are no buttons, so you have to press down to simulate a left click.  There seems to be nothing to simulate a right click.The bottom line is that, for the price, it's a great value.

Paired with Google docs/drive, and all of the plugins available for them, it is very easy to create and manage many different types of files, including essays, presentations, spreadsheets, flowcharts, etc. The one reservation I have when recommending it to others is that the graphics capabilities are EXTREMELY limited. I'm talking about even just trying to watch videos on YouTube. It doesn't seem to process anything higher than 480p very well, and even that can be sketchy at times.When using Chrome Remote Desktop, you can access your home PC with all of its computing power using this chromebook. It is also helpful when you want to run an application that is not web based, but keep in mind the lack of graphics processing / rendering, as well as wifi speeds, will keep you from using this devise as a ""wireless monitor"" for your pc. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase, and continue to use it every day at school for taking notes and doing homework.

I wanted a device with a keyboard that I could use to surf the Internet, check email, type documents, create to-do lists, update my calendar, and complete quick calculations. I've found all of that and more with Chromebook.Now, as other reviewers have mentioned, the learning curve might be just a bit steep for those unused to Google's products (besides their search engine, of course). But I'm telling you, once you get the hang of using Google Docs for typing documents, Google slides for creating presentations, Google Calendar for setting dates, etc., you will not want to go back. If you lose your Chromebook or find yourself without it, you can go onto any device that connects to the Internet and find your documents, presentation, calendar, etc.Technically, you don't even need a Chromebook to use those products, just a Google account. But then you wouldn't have such an efficient, fast machine to use them on--and why would you ever want that?---------Just a couple notes on the downsides:1. Printing is an issue if you don't have a ""Cloud Print Ready"" printer. Since I don't, my computer scientist husband had to find a work-around.2. You cannot download external programs. I have to keep my old laptop around for when I want to use iTunes, Blackboard IM (for school), and my scanner.

200,"Because I'm really reviewing too different products, the physical Samsung netbook and the Chrome OS, I'll separate my review.Samsung NetbookPros- Keyboard is big enough for even large hands.- Netbook is thin, light weight- Battery life is around 7-9 hours, depending on use- Screen is large enough for most work, but small enough to be portable- Contains a decent webcam- Excellent price - you can't beat $249.00Cons- Only two USB ports- No old-fashioned monitor ports, so I can't connect this netbook to most projectors at my school- Keyboard sometimes strains my small hands because it's almost too large- No delete key (backspace sometimes works for this)- No capslock keyChrome OSPros- Instant boot, which is really quite awesome- Very little to no bloatware- East to use, no setup- The Play Store has a lot of really innovative apps that can make one's life easierCons(where do I even start?)- No Dropbox integrationLet me explain what I mean by this. Yes, I can pin the dropbox WEBSITE to the taskbar and instant it easily (kind of like an easily accessible bookmark), but using it on this laptop is difficult and tedious. To get a file from dropbox, I must download it, which downloads to my computer's hard drive. Then, I have to upload it into Drive. If I try to open it right away, however, I can't edit. It opens it into a Viewer app which is the most unhelpful and irritating app on this device. So, I must open it manually into the Sheets app, which will let me edit. Then, after editing, I have to download the file as a proper .xls/.doc/.ppt to my computer's hard drive. This inevitably changes the file name, which I then have to manually rename so that it will replace the original file when I upload it to dropbox. Then, go back to the dropbox site and upload it, and it then syncs with my other devices. And of course the formatting is changed, so when I open it elsewhere, I either have to deal with ugly formatting or change it before I can use the document.Yes, I could use Drive, but this brings me to the next annoying part of Chrome OS:- Every file must be changed to Google's native file types before they can be added to Drive or used in any wayThis just adds another unnecessary step to everything, whether I want to upload to Dropbox or send the file to someone else.- Google Office apps are just inferiorThey are difficult to use, they unnecessarily have different file extensions that must be changed to use with Microsoft Office programs, and the formatting never looks as nice. There are also fewer options.- Every app requires internet connectivity to work fullyFor some reason, Google decided it would be a great idea to limit the functionality of its apps if the computer isn't connected to the internet. This means that if I'm making a slideshow online, I can't add a picture to my slides whatsoever. Even though I made to sure to add the image files to my computer the night before so that I could make the slideshow while I was at work where I am not lucky enough to have internet. Why? It makes no sense whatsoever.So, in summary, that's why I gave this review three stars. I'm very impressed with the Samsung netbook, but not very impressed with the Chrome OS. I'm currently looking into trying to have the option to boot to Ubuntu as well, because Chrome OS unnecessarily limits my productivity and creates unnecessary barriers to smooth operations I performs everyday.

The set up is a breeze and Google takes care of all the rest, Internet security, virus protection, software updates, word processing program all for free.

I let Google know how I feel about that too!It's not like I was trying to scam them, I legitimately had a problem that was resolved by resetting, but loosing the free storage was simply not fair, and I've yet to hear a response from Google in regards to my complaint.But overall you will love this maintenance free solution to surfing the web.

So, since saving is not an option offline, at least not with my limited understanding of this damned device, I closed up shop and decided to come back to my room to upload my papers.  Turns out my chromebook decided to restart of its own free will and my papers no longer exist.  I officially hate Chromebook.  Don't buy this product if you wish to maintain important documents.Original Post:I live on a very small island in the British Indian Ocean and I bought this in hopes that I would have a more portable lap top to carry around the island with me while I do my writing and update from my older gargantuan laptop that has a battery life of 1.5 hours, when in use and takes forever to load anything.So, I'll start with the positives1. It's small2. It looks cool3. The battery life is amazing!4. Even with my super slow internet, this loads pages really quick.5. google drive is pretty awesome6. autosave on written documentsThere a probably many more pluses, but these are as they pertain to my needs.now for the negatives1. Not compatible with skype2. no java3. no adobe4. most apps do not work offline (which is anywhere outside my partment) if they work at all.and this becomes the even greater negatives5. the chromebook becomes EXTREMELY limited when working offline6. any writing that I do offline is lost once I return to online status unless I cut and paste to a new document.7. document that I write online, are not accessible offline.  even if I download them to the computer, they are not always able to be opened.

203,"I got this device as an alternative to a tablet. My laptop had finally taken enough abuse and needed to be retired. I was done with college and all I really used the laptop for was internet browsing, facebooking, and online gaming (like Facebook games). It has worked very well for that purpose. If you're looking for something that runs Microsoft products, iTunes, or any other downloadable software, this is not the device for you... but if all you're looking for is a tablet with a keyboard, look at the Google Chromebook.It's incredibly lightweight. When I picked it up I nearly threw it b/c I expected more weight. When they say it fires up in 10 seconds, they are no kidding. I've restarted my device probably 20 times and it's never taken longer than 10 seconds to be fully usable.It does have word processing and spreadsheet capabilities, but I have never used these features.It's easy to use and navigate. My three year old has no trouble starting the browser and getting to her websites. My son loves the ease of using YouTube.For $200, you really can't go wrong - unless you're looking for an all inclusive laptop. This is NOT an all-inclusive laptop. It's simply a tablet with a keyboard - which is perfect for my needs. :)

204,"I bought this product as an affordable replacement for my older laptop that was beginning to give me problems (constant humming noise that made it difficult to focus).  For web based browsing activities, this device is perfect.  I like the fact that it weighs so little (about 2 lbs) and is therefore very portable, unlike some laptops that basically are like lugging a ""desktop laptop"".  Unlike my previous computer, this computer stays relatively cool and warms up only when the outside temperature is warm (~80 F).There is one major limitation of the chromebook:  the relative incompatibility with Microsoft Office files.  While the chrome browser allows reading of these documents, you cannot edit them with this laptop.  Luckily there are two ways to get around this:  SkyDrive and Chrome Remote Desktop.  SkyDrive is the Microsoft version of Google Drive and as you can imagine, it allows you to store your Office documents (.docx, .xlsx, etc) in the cloud and edit them.  With Chrome Remote Desktop, you can control one of your Windows or Mac machines that has Office installed.Storage is minimal on the device, but since Google Drive recently consolidated both Gmail and Drive storage, you now get up to 30 GB of cloud storage, which is probably enough for most web based and document uses.  I personally have a 1 TB external hard drive for physical copies of my documents as well,The battery life is amazing, by far, for any of the laptops that I have owned to this point.  I always used to have to worry about bringing the laptop charger around wherever I brought the laptop.  Not with this chromebook.  Battery life is at least 5 hours, though this is highly dependent on usage patterns and whether or not you have USB devices plugged in, as these draw power from the computer.Overall, I'm very happy with the purchase of this device. I highly recommend it for those who use their computer for web-based and document processing activities

205,"I won't bore you with long details that others have already pointed out. But just to go over the PROs quickly, mine are:1. The keyboard blows away the Acer model, it's worth the extra $502. The trackpad is impressive. Not as great as a Macbook, but pretty darn close with the right click and scrolling functionalities.3. Fast boot timeI should say the greatest point is the ever-growing support for third party plug-ins. I bought this with the fear that it won't run certain web applications such as Adobe Connect. I was disappointed to find out it does not initially support Adobe Connect and was close to returning the Chromebook. However, after additional research I found out that there is a plug-in available in the Chrome Store that supports Adobe Connect. I crossed my fingers and tested the plug-in. Guess what? Works perfectly. I was stunned. I'm confident in a few months Google will sort out other limitations.

206,"I bought this in place on an Apple macbook.  Although it has it limitations, for students it could not be better. First is the price. At $250 it is quarter the price of a macbook. Second is its utility. All my children now do homework on Google docs. They never use  MS Word, or actually any other application. If they do homework in Google docs they can access it from home or school.  In addition, 90% of what they do is on the internet. There is not a single application that they use on the Apple Macs we have at home (we have 9) that they use.  So, I no longer have to upgrade software, install software, or operate an a IS manager.The computer basically requires a virtual internet connection, true. But how much do you do without that?  You can work offline on documents.  Kids  only do homework, go on social media, watch movies and listen to music. They can do all of that since you have netflix, pandora, spotify, etc.I have read reviews critical of computer, but the #1 issue is price. I dread giving a 15 year old a $1000 computer. They break things, lose things, and generally just abuse them.  You can buy 4 chrome books for the cost of 1 macbook.  Also, it has good connections such as USB port and micro SD. The limitations It has I think will evaporate over time with updates to OS and second party software.

207,"This really is a nice little machine, does everything a Chromebook should... almost.  I didn't realize when I bought this, but because it uses the ARM processor instead of the Intel/AMD types, Netflix doesn't stream to it.  Apparently Netflix works fine on the other Chromebooks, but because their software is 'platform specific', it just doesn't work with the ARM processor.  For me, this would have been a deal breaker had I known as I rather enjoy netlix.  Also, Skype has no Chromebook app, so you must rely on an app such as Imo, which doesn't work nearly as good (long lag times when messaging, logging you in and out at odd times).  So, as a little machine to fill the niche in my 'entertainment' schedule on the road, this Chromebook fails in two important (for me) areas.  Other than that, it is attractive for an all plastic item... the keyboard is wonderful.  The processor is as 'snappy' as they advertise, multiple windows/apps dont slow it down, video looks great.... it has USB 3.0 support which is great....  I hope the Netflix/Skype issues get ironed out at some point, then I'll be 100% satisfied.

208,"I've waited a while to write this review because I just wasn't sure what to say about this Chromebook.  I knew it wouldn't be a full fledged laptop.  I don't need a laptop for the purpose I'm using the Chromebook.  That being said, I can only give it three stars.  The first several weeks I had the Chromebook I was tempted to return it.  It was extremely slow at loading content.  I mean, r e a l l y  s l o w.  Now, several weeks later, it seems to be loading faster in some instances.  Other times we go back to the slow loading.  I'm using it for Facebook, email and certain websites that I have bookmarked for shopping.  I can play my Facebook games on here just fine although sometimes there's a lag.  All in all, I'm not returning it because I don't need a laptop for what I'm using this Chromebook for.  However, I'm a little disappointed in the loading speed.

209,"I got this as a Birthday gift for my Wife. She had been using a G tablet (connected to a USB keyboard) to keep in touch with her relatives across the World via Facebook and Skype. This is in spite of the fact we have a full-size Desktop Computer, she liked being in the Sun on the other side of the house. The G tablet was fine at first but required lots of updating and tinkering on my part due to the Android OS. I read about the Chromebook and decided it would be perfect for her needs of surfing and chatting. She LOVES her Chromebook. It's light, it boots up super-fast, and it was easy to setup. The keyboard is really nice and the screen is good. The speakers while a bit tinny are decent and she streams Pandora all the time now. It's light enough that she'll take it wherever she needs. AS LONG AS YOU HAVE ACCESS TO WI-FI AND UNDERSTAND IT'S LIMITATIONS YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED. Also understand that updates are coming, such as Netflix compatibility (Youtube and Hulu work fine) and greater gaming choices. You'll need to have a Gmail account, which is free. For the causal Internet Surfer and Chatter and simple game player, the Samsung Chromebook is a KILLER deal.

210,"We were so excited to switch out entire company over to Chromebooks.  I thought that I did a lot of research, but I was wrong.  First of all, these little babies are sweet.  Super fast computing and boot-up, really neat ""bells and whistles""...if you are using as your home computer, I would recommend it as a GREAT alternative to a Macbook.  That is why I give it 5 stars, because their utility is great, just not for business.  But seeing that we were transitioning our company to the ChromeBook's there are some major concerns that need to be addressed before you think about making the dive.1. Any website that was built for Internet Explorer (you will know by trying to use the site in Google Chrome, without using any extensions, and the site acts funny), will not work in the Chromebook.  We were under the impression the IE Tab and other extensions like this, would remedy the problem.  They wont, at all. Those extensions were only built for Windows based operating systems that you use Chrome as your primary search engine.  I even spoke to a product specialist with Google Apps, and he even said that there are ZERO options for me out there, even with a ton of research after I spoke to him, any of the programs are very slow if they offer any utility at all.  So, in closing, any websites built of IE WILL NOT be available to work in using the Chrome Book.2. Using Adobe is a nightmare.  We use Adobe Pro everyday and we use Adobe reader for EVERY SINGLE document.  It is beat down to open a PDF (a three step process) and the alternative to Adobe Pro is a very weak counterpart.  I imagine that Adobe will produce a ChromeBook app, which will be a work around, but until then, don't attempt, it takes too much time to do the step-by-step process to make it attempt to be as useful as Adobe Pro.3. We use dual monitors, which is a productivity booster, so I was excited to see that the ChromeBook supported that, but what they don't tell you is that there is NO WAY to close the lid to the ChromeBook  with out the computer going into sleep mode.  This is a bit of a pain because you lose a lot of space now having an open laptop on your desk.All in all, great computer if you dont regularly use word, excel or pdf's.  Seeing that Google Chrome works on about 95% of sites out there, then rest assured that you will be in good shape with the computer as a home computer...great utility!

211,"I read all the negative complaints about it was worthless because you can download anything or it has to be connected to the internet to be worth anything.  It appears that most of those people never read just what the Chromebook is all about.I read and read and then read some reviews about the Chromebook.  I went back and forth between whether to buy a notebook the same size but cost more and I could download and save to the harddrive.  Well, it became evident that I really use it when I am away from my desktop PC.  What are my activities?  I surf the web and check email.  Rarely do I need to do any work from it.I have all my important data/photos stored on skydrive.  I used Office 2013 on my desktop.  Well, Chromebook has a skydrive app.  I can open up my files there and edit them using Office web app version.  I can watch Amazon prime movies and about 3 weeks later after getting my Chromebook, I can now watch Netflex as well.  Hey, I am a happy camper with the Chromebook.Yes, it has limitations but I was aware of them going in and I am quite please with the speed and quality of the Samsung Chromebook.  If you understand what it means to be in the cloud, then this is a good notebook replacement for when you are away from your desktop.

212,"I purchased the Samsung Wi-Fi Chromebook because I needed something fast and portable. I have a large powerful Windows-running laptop for work so I didn't need another PC. I also satisfied my need for something Apple with an iPhone 4S (but I will be upgraded to the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 when my contract is up at the end of the year. Sorry, Apple, I don't want your ugly gold iPhone.) ANYWAY. I love this Chromebook. It is the best deal for the price. If you looking for a computer to give a teenager or a college kid it's great for that. Transferring between Google Docs and Microsoft Word (or the other programs) is simple, so that's not an excuse to not buy the Chromebook. It takes some time getting used to how everything runs but once you get it it is simple. If you love keyboard shortcuts, the Chromebook is full of them. This machine is versatile and sleek (it really looks like a MacBook Air but is a fraction of the cost). It is very light and portable. It has a good battery life and charges quickly. If you're already using Google Chrome as your browser, doing typical internet things is exactly the same.Things I Do With The Chromebook:-Watch TV/Netflix. Unplug the HDMI cable from your cable box and put it in the Chromebook. You can mirror the screens or use the TV as a second monitor. Anyway, I can stream movies quickly right on to the TV.-Listen to music. I have a two Bluetooth speakers and the Chromebook connects right to them. With the Pandora app, you're good to rock out.-Work. I can create docs using Google's apps, save them to the drive and then open them on my PC in a Microsoft program if necessary.-Social media stuff. It's the same as on a traditional computer.I know I'm not using the device to its full potential and there are so many more uses and applications. The reps at a Best Buy are great and will talk to you about how to make the Chromebook do what you want it to do.I'm pretty sure I will be purchasing two more Chromebooks during the holiday season (on Amazon).Happy browsing!UPDATE: I've had this Chromebook for 10 months. It still works perfectly (minus the normal hiccups that would come from having my Chromebook set on the Beta channel. Dev scares me though.) ANYWAY a few weeks ago I had my Chromebook on the coffee table next to a glass of water. During the night, one of my cats knocked the glass over (yes, I am a cat lady). Since it was a busy few days at work, I didn't notice my Chromebook had been sitting in a puddle of water for two days (when I finally had time to sit in front of the TV again; remember I have separate work computer...). I was pretty disappointed. I knew I could buy another Chromebook...BUT this was my modded-out personalized Chromebook and I didn't want to reprogram all of my settings. I turned it over and let all of the water drip out. When I was sure there was no water left in it I plugged it in and let it charge up--when I plugged the charger in the light went on--this is a really good sign. I let it charge for about 2 hours. Then the moment of truth.....it WORKED. It turned on like nothing had happened. I was surprised, but not shocked. I know Samsung makes great products. I love this thing. . . I don't know what else to say.

213,"The Samsung Chromebook is perhaps the best value in an electronic device that I have ever owned.  I was already a heavy user of Google services (browser, mail, calendar, documents, music, videos, talk, etc.) so it was not a hard decision to buy one when this new version came out, primarily for taking notes during an evening literature course.  My regular computer is a Mac mini.The Chromebook was on backorder but when it came back in stock, I placed the order and it arrived the afternoon before the first class.  It is so simple and intuitive that I was able to get it set up and become familiar enough with it to take notes in class that evening without any problems, although I did go a few minutes early to set up the Wi-Fi.  It also allows me to have access to Kindle books while in class for the discussion.It really is much better than I expected it to be.  I was surprised at how thin and attractive it is compared to the photographs—they make it look clunky.  It is about the size of a standard spiral-bound notebook.  Even the power brick is small.From reading the reviews, I was very worried about the quality of the screen and its brightness but the matte screen is ideal for my use and it is more than bright enough—I don't even keep it on high.  I was also worried that it would look and feel cheap, flex, and scratch easily.  It is definitely plastic and not metal but I appreciate the how light it is and have not had trouble with it scratching and the hinge is sturdy.  The only way it feels cheap is that concentrated pressure on the back of the lid will cause ripples in the screen.  It is not the most powerful computer as far as storage and RAM but I think of it as a tablet with a keyboard rather than as a laptop.Other things I really like are how it starts up almost instantly, the excellent quality of the keyboard and touchpad, how easily it connects to Wi-Fi, and the attractive design. The design is also very thoughtful in little ways such as the slot to open it with, the placement of the headphone jack, and the special function keys.There are definitely some things I don't like.  It is very difficult to select text with the touchpad so at home, I use a wireless mouse when I want to copy & paste or format text.  Every once in a while, when I am taking notes, the Google Docs tab crashes and says ""Aw, Snap!""  I have never lost anything and it is easy to recover from that by opening a new tab but it is aggravating and I don't know why it happens.  I also do not feel 100% comfortable using public Wi-Fi so I have sometimes used it in class without connecting to it.Overall, though, I really like the Samsung Chromebook.  It won't meet everyone's needs but it certainly is excellent for what it is intended to be and for my purposes.

214,"I bought this shortly after finally purchasing two tablets; a Galaxy Note 8.0 and a Galaxy Note 10.1.  I wanted to try it all, and see where my mobile needs led me.  Honestly, if I had bought this first, I'm not sure I would have bothered with the tablets.  Tablets are probably superior for games, and consuming entertainment media, which I can't do that much, due to limited internet access.  I love that I can sit on the porch and type away, or read the news, research topics of interest, and I don't have to hold the screen, as a tablet requires.  I didn't even bother to read the Quick Start Guide; the Chromebook just leads you along - and I'm barely tech literate.  As I needed to learn how to do things like Copy and Paste, access the Bookmarks bar, Zoom on the screen etc, I just 'Googled' my question to find the answer.  Google has made sure that detailed, clear and easy instructions are right there online, for all my questions so far.  I cannot believe that this tiny laptop was less than half the price of my 10 inch tablet.  I also bought a 32 GB SanDisk Cruzer Fit usb drive and it is so tiny you can barely see that it's inserted behind the hinge.  It's easy to be mobile with that little flash drive inserted - just leave it in.  I haven't tried an SD card yet, but I've read that it sticks out beyond the little door; too bad, it would be nice if it fit neatly inside, like a micro sd card does on a phone or tablet.  I am new to Googe Drive, but so far I love it.  I don't think I will use it for larger files like photos, because my internet is via my cell phone, and I have to watch my data consumption.  But for documents it's great; easy and accessible from all my devices.  All my old documents that happened to be in Google Docs magically appeared in the list!  Like old pals.  And even with Google Drive, you have the option of storing the documents on the usb drive.  The keyboard is a little harder touch than I'm used to, but I'm adapting quickly.  It's a nice keyboard; feels solid.  Battery life seems like it would be around 5 - 6 hours of continuous use.  I haven't really pushed it that far, but that's what the control panel is telling me, I think.  I haven't really explored all the available apps yet.  I've hardly opened my Macbook Pro since getting this little Chromebook.  Love the way it boots up almost instantly, just like a tablet.  Flash memory; yay!
            "
215,"UPDATE (for clarification):  It is important to note that Google Chrome OS is different than the Android operating system used on mobile phones.  They have both a Linux based Kernel (roughly the word for core software engine) but Android has many Java based elements (one of the reasons why the 'controllers'(Sun Microsystems) of Java sewed Google.  So Android apps need some adjustment to run in the Google Chrome OS environment, which is a completely browser based OS with its roots in Linux.  It would be easier to simply use Android (have access to all the apps) or the other, and there have been rumors that they merge (unlikely but possible?!).  There is good reason for Google to have Chrome OS to compete with Windows, so who knows.  So when I said it's a tablet with a keyboard (see review below), it really is kind of its own thing.  It would be nice if it was a tablet with a keyboard (Android apps 100% no issue).  No matter what, Google has invested a lot in Google Chrome and will support it in the future.  It's just important to note that the Chromebook is at least a great web browser enabled tool, but it's not a complete substitute for a Windows laptop or MacBook Pro with all the s/w installed on a local base.  Web based apps will have some delays and will depend on a decent wifi connection, and how busy the webservers are running other people's apps etc etc.  But it's a neat tool.  You have to understand what you are buying here though.  It's not a traditional laptop as we are used to.This is really neat for on the go or browsing the web on the sofa.It is basically a tablet with a very decent keyboard (to me the same keyboard quality as an Apple MacBook Air or MacBook Pro (this one is nicely backlit), both of which I own and use...Samsung makes the Apple processors in the USA as well as the ones inside this ChromeBook, of course totally different CPUs) and mouse pad (the screen is not a touch screen to not mislead you with the term tablet).  And this is key to understand:  the technology and the micro chip powering this is a processor powering many Samsung tablets; it's for mobile use and concepts.  I should also mention that I am electronics engineer and that I am involved with what's inside that unit.  I purchased this for someone who needed a computer that is portable and can get all the things done young people in particular 'need' ... You Tube, Facebook, Twitter etcThe computing power available in this unit gets it all done sufficiently.  The idea of this unit is that it runs OS Google Chrome and that everything is cloud based, meaning you store most of your stuff on the web primarily (and 16GB of local storage to hold apps and immediately needed stuff) , so it's accessible on any computer anywhere in the world even if you do not carry your Chrome Book with you.  Therefore the 16GB local storage are enough for most people, and the unit comes with 100GB of cloud based storage (Google Drive Cloud Storage) (free for 2 years and then a nominal fee, check with Google).  This chrome book has 2GB DDR3 RAM and a 16 GB Solid State Drive (no mechanical harddrive), sufficient to not limit you (and there is an SD card reader for more stuff).  What's important to have is the WiFi connection, so you can browse the web and use the cloud storage and use all your apps (Of course you can play locally stored apps like angry bird etc).  This computer has a very good wifi radio with all the standards running (wifi 802.11 a/b/g/n 2x2).  It also has blue tooth, so you can stream your music channels from Pandora to an external Bluetooth compatible speaker system for example.  Works great.The machine is as good as the apps you use (word processing, spreadsheet etc) in rough terms.  There is software/apps to be productive on the go, play,read, or browse the web (with wifi connection) or 'socialize' with Facebook etc...I meant to say use social media ;-).This Chromebook is connectivity itself.  It has the newest USB 3.0 port and also a USB2.0 port to afford all compatibility and speed.  It has a HDMI port, so you can playback anything on your big screen.  There is an SD card reader.  And as mentioned wifi of course (the lifeline to make this what it is for) and the Bluetooth interface (3.0). There are internal stereo speakers (ok) and headphone/mic connectivity.  External storage is really unlimited (the web itself or in more practical terms all the web server space you 'own/lease' , so you are not limited by the previously mentioned 100GB of free for 2 years Google Drive Cloud Storage (you can rent more) and there are other safe on-line storage solutions which you can access from anywhere in the world with or without your chrome book).  So the future of your stuff does not depend on the lifetime of your Chromebook in case you end its life going diving with it.The screen is a low-glare matte screen in HD quality (11.6"" with 1366 x 768 pixels), which you can appreciate if you ever owned a MacBook Air etc and you cannot control the lighting situation.The battery can last a lot longer than 6 hours (I have seen 8 hours), officially 6.5 hours average.Booting up is about instant due to the solid state storage (and the operating system) once the machine had been set up with google credentials and the wifi, which takes 'no time'.  The Chromebook updates automatically and because everything is cloud based, virus protection is build in and there is no extra software required for that, so really completely carefree operation.I wish I had this option a few years ago when I purchased my MacBook Air for ~ $1500.  Of course this Chromebook is high quality plastic, but it is surprisingly solid considering the cost of this ChromeBook.Overall this gets 5 stars for what this unit delivers from functionality to value to ease of operation.  Can't go wrong with this purchase in my opinion.

216,"After only six months of use, the battery is shot. The Chromebook will say it has 3 hours left and a few minutes later it dies. I never know when it will die. I'm very frustrated. I made a request to return this item and it was denied. The Chromebook still works, but now I have to keep it charged at all times to make sure it doesn't die. Many times I have been working on something very important and the stupid thing dies. It's disappointing, because I spent 175 dollars and this Chromebook is a defective product. The sellers won't let me return it to get my money back. Ocean Reef Outlet is the seller. I suggest you never ever buy from them, you cannot trust them!!!

217,"I'm coming back here years after purchasing to leave a good review, because it's still working.  The battery swelled up because I left it discharged in a drawer for a while.  (we broke the charger.  the charge port is on the spine, so that's fairly easy to do)  But the thing is built so you can service it with one normal phillips head screwdriver, so I bought a new battery and swapped it for the old one.  (be careful with swollen batteries.  Make sure bring it to a hardware store or someplace to dispose of it properly).  Thing was back up and running in a heartbeat.  I do recommend looking up on online teardown guide first - I broke one of the snaps because I didn't realize you're supposed to pull the spine cover off first.Anyway my point is, if you buy this, you'll be able to fix it when it breaks.  That's good for the environment, and good for your wallet.

Just enter about:flags in the browser. Be careful though.b) You can install a basic Ubuntu interface and hot-swap between the two OSes, but I find myself using the Chrome OS all the time.c) It's really nicely built. I really like the design of this cheapo Chromebook.d) Google updated their Chrome apps for offline usage!******************************************Let's keep this simple.Pros:- Very cheap. I bought a used/very good one directly from Amazon Warehouse for $145+tax. That's at least 50% cheaper than the cheapest 10"" tablet.- Nice looking laptop. Very clean design with round edges.- Light as well. I can see myself carrying this around with one hand easily.- Decent-sized and responsive keypad. This is easily a deal-maker.- Nice and big trackpad. Supports multi-touch.- Chrome Web Store has plenty of apps to do whatever you want.Cons: (let's keep in mind that this is a $150-200 notebook)- Screen lacks contrast, saturation and has a rather narrow viewing angle.- Trackpad is just nice, not great. Limited multi-touch gestures.- A little slow. Maybe it's ChromeOS, maybe it's the hardware. But doesn't run as smooth as I'd like it to.- Just web apps. But hey, it's a Chromebook. I just wish the button in taskbar didn't say ""apps"" when they're really just links to websites.Overall, I feel that this is a great product from Samsung. And assuming you'll always have internet whenever you use it, this will be a great traveling companion.

I do my heavy lifting on a MacBook pro: Photoshop, iMovie, etc... and I use my iPad or Nexus 7 device for creating things, watching videos and other casual use.  I am a huge fan of the chromebook though and think it is a necessity.  I can not give up the other devices since I use each of them differently.  I would consider myself a power user of Microsoft Office but have been able to convert almost entirely to Google Docs (...).  What I lose in terms of advanced features I gain in terms of collaboration, publication and access.  I can access Google Docs on almost any device.  While I can view and kind of edit on my iPad, the chromebook gives me full access to my Google Docs.  The chromebook is incredibly lightweight (almost seems less heavy than my iPad) so it is perfect for carrying around.  Very rarely do I need to do power computing on the go, mostly I need to access my Google Docs and do other Web 2.0 or even Web 1.0 things.  This makes the Chromebook the perfect device. I can bring it with me to Starbucks or a meeting and have a fully working computer.As a teacher I would recommend the chromebook for the classroom, it is a wonderful device that besides being lightweight and robust allows students to log into any machine with their Google account (especially great if your school is Google Apps).  Thus students do not need to be assigned a device, they can jump on any classroom chromebook and have instant access to their files, apps and projects.  Google Drive is an excellent substitute for dropbox, so students can keep all of their files in Google Drive and then have access to them on any machine.  Although, drop box is functional on the chromebook, the integration with Drive makes it a much easier choice. The battery on the chromebook also lasts a long time so the teacher can put out the chromebooks at the beginning of the day and have them last the entire school day without being plugged in.  This eliminates the power cord hazards.

220,"I've owned this Chromebook for 6 months now, and have only touched my ""real"" laptop once since.Pros:1. Battery Life:  I routinely get 6-7 hours of battery life.2. Weight: I throw the Chromebook in my bag in the morning and barely notice it.  You have to spend at least 3x to get another laptop that beats the weight.3. Keyboard/touchpad: Excellent - easily in the same league as a Macbook.4. Fanless/Silent: This Chromebook is completely silent because there is no fan.  This is awesome when watching videos or listening to music where traditional laptops would have annoying fan noise.5. Auto updates: no prompts, no nagware, etc.  Always getting better, just like chrome.6. Screen is decent: Gets bright enough to be easily visible in direct sun.  Usual resolution, hopefully the next version will have more pixels.7. Speakers get nice and loud.  Decent fidelty - much better than my old laptop speakers.8. Boots and resumes instantly.Software-wise, it's great for me as a developer.  I use crouton (google ""github crouton"") and can easily switch into xfce ubuntu when I want to fire up Eclipse. I've had no trouble at all with ARM ubuntu packages - everything is just a apt-get install away.The exynos cpu is suprisingly powerful.  I can open 30-40 tabs and not experience slow downs or any stuttering when listening to Google Music or Spotify in the background.  There is some lag when first starting high def video, but this seems to have gotten better in one of the many updates - pretty cool when you open your laptop and suddenly things work better.Cons:I wish the chrome vpn support was a little better.  I'm using openvpn from the shell, and sometimes it refuses to start up, but once it's running it's solid.I accidentally switched back to non-developer mode a few days after getting everything set up, which wiped out my chroot.  Don't press the spacebar at the developer mode startup screen.  It hasn't happened in the 5 months since, so probably just user error on my part.For my needs, and considering the price, this laptop is nearly perfect.  The low price means I have piece of mind and don't have to worry about breaking it or getting it stolen.  The cost savings over a comparable ultrabook or Macbook are enormous.  I could buy another xe303 and build desktop for gaming with the savings.

221,"Some quick background information on me and why I bought the product:I am a full time pre-med student who also works full time. Weekends aside, in any given day I have 1-3 hours outside of my school-work-sleep cycle to study for exams, meet other students for group projects, and generally try to stay ahead of the curve in a very competitive, science-heavy curriculum.I bought the chromebook to help me keep everything organized. I frequently found myself in need of a small computer I could use to review notes, check grades, and turn in student assignments. The chromebook does that trick very well. I bought the Case Star Neoprene Laptop Notebook Sleeve (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008FU1HE0/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2) to protect it in the messenger bag I use at school. It was quite cheap, and works great.Pros: -Small, portable, most painless setup I've ever experienced. It was up and running within less than 3 minutes of plugging it in. -Syncs to your Gmail account automatically, including Google docs, anything on your Google drive, keeps your bookmark preferences. -Fairly durable. I'm pretty hard on stuff and I've definitely scuffed it up and have a tendency to leave it in sleep rather than turning it all the way off, for weeks at a time. It performs just as well now as it did the day I got it. -**Notetaking** is a serious breeze with the Chromebook. I have *all* of my notes, for every single class on my chromebook, which automatically syncs to my drive. (This is great because you have automatic, instantaneous access from anywhere you can log into Google.) -MS Excel and PowerPoint knockoffs that work pretty well. I've given in-class presentations with these softwares. -Probably not news to anyone, but it reads PDFs, Excel docs, .docx files perfectly well. The problem comes with editing them. -gdocs exports .docx, .PDF, and .rtf files flawlessly 95% of the time. (Look out for export issues in advanced editing situations like highlighting.)Cons:I have three gripes with the Chromebook, and three only: - No MS Office. This can be a real pain, and though eventually I'm sure Google will get ahead of Microsoft and work out fairly flawless conversion algorithms, the fact is, they're just not there. Converting a project that you started in the lab on Excel over to Google's spreadsheet software is functionally impossible. The data will not properly transfer and you'll be left with an unusable mess. -No touchscreen. I understand that asking for a touchscreen in this price segment is unreasonable, and I'd be happy to pay more for it, but it can be really frustrating to try and sketch the molecular structure of a hydrocarbon with the gdocs ""Insert drawing"" function using the built-in touch-pad. -The Bluetooth doesn't really work. Peripherals like mice and keyboards seem to function fine, but using Bluetooth headphones or a boombox is problematic. They will sync and begin working fine, but after a few minutes invariably they start skipping and it only gets worse from there. I troubleshot at length, different environments to control for interference, using multiple different devices, all from unique manufacturers, etc. Same thing no matter what. After doing some searching I learned that it is a known issue with some of the chromebooks, and that they are supposedly working on it, but with a nebulous due date on the patch. I don't expect them to ever fix it, but for me, it's not that big of a deal. I'm never far enough away from it to need Bluetooth, and my Galaxy S3 works just fine if I need some study jams.Overall - Great experience. I would have given 5 stars if not for the Bluetooth issue, as that is the only thing they promised, but didn't deliver. My Chromebook is constantly with me, at all times, and it really shines on the note-taking front. I'm one of the few people in the university to use a laptop of any kind to take notes, and it gives me the opportunity to grab a lot more information than those who are writing. I like being able to catch the little stories each prof tells about their experiences with x concept. I find these tidbits help me put a color on those ideas and remember them better.Tips for taking notes on the Chromebook: -Get familiar with the keyboard shortcuts specific to gdocs word processor. It will save you buckets of time. -If you have a chem-heavy curriculum try hitting Google images for molecular structures to save time. Just make sure it matches what Prof is doing on the board. -If you have a chem or math-heavy curriculum and need to use Greek and other letters like Sigma, Delta, or delta+/delta- frequently (thermodynamics, kinetics, intermolecular forces, etc.) make a table of all the applicable symbols and units (like kj/mol for instance) ahead of time, and paste it to the bottom of your notes before class starts. This way you can simply ctrl+c/ctrl+v (copy/paste) them into your notes without wasting time diving for them in the gdocs drop-downs. -Make some time after lab to rough-draft your report on campus in a computer lab. Or do it at home if you have access to MS Office. Don't waste your time trying to build lab reports unless they don't need graphs, or you and your lab partner(s) are both comfortable pulling up your gmail and running all your data in Google's spreadsheet software. (Could probably done. I'll report back if I even get a chance to try this.) -If you're re-writing notes in your own words for exams (which you definitely should be), rewrite them by hand. You're going to spend more time thinking about it when you have to slow down enough to physically write.

222,"I already have a notebook that is 2 years old and after using my tablets the notebook seems like it weighs a ton. I love that I can slip a tablet in my purse when I travel but sometimes I need more than a tablet. The Chromebook is perfect for me! It is lightweight and the keyboard is just as good as the one on my notebook and I think the touch pad is better. I did have to increase the font a little for my aging eyes but that was simple to do. I have been using Chrome browser since it first came out so this was simple for me. I've been very happy with this purchase but I am a fan of Google products, also have a Nexus 7 tablet so I might be prejudiced. If you just want a little more than a tablet and still want to take it along with you, give this a look. Read the tech reviews. This is the model you want, not the lower priced model from a different manufacturer or the higher priced one from the same manufacturer.

223,"I got this computer just so I could bring a computer onto campus, as my old ""laptop"" is practically a desktop now. It is smaller than I expected, but besides that, I had the battery say i had 12 hours left at 87%, its extremely fast for browsing the web, It runs PDF's perfectly, runs flash, and perhaps the best thing is that it brings all your information from google chrome on your other devices and syncs them immediately. I love this computer already, and I have only had it for 2 days. Would highly suggest this to anybody who is on the go alot, and has access to wireless internet. Google Drive is super helpful for transporting documents from computer to computer. The controls are super fluent, and the transitions from screen to screen fade in and out nicely. 10/10 computer, especially for only $250.

224,"For 123.00 used in ""like new"" condition...including tax...this is definitely 5 star worthy. To the people saying you cannot watch Netlfix on here, you can. You have to download the newest version of Chrome OS. I am able to watch Netflix. It's the reason I bought this. It does not have a CD drive but I was not looking for that. I love it. It may not last longer than a year or two but for just a little over 100 bucks, I can't really complain. I love how thin and light it is. I'm sure there are things it can't do compared other laptops but... again, it's inexpensive, you get what you pay for.

225,"I have used the 303C-A01 for almost two years then Google performed an operating system update called version 40 and now it will not maintain WiFi lock. Several WiFi losses can occur in a 15 minute period. There is no real way to speak to Google directly, only to S/W developers who only want assistance rather than hearing complaints. Chromebook user forums are also developer oriented and not a good place to vent complaints or frustrations. The problem seems to be prevalent with Belkin routers but the developers are grasping at straws and pointing  fingers at angry users. Google needs to replace the 303C units with the newer 500 series but so far has taken no action. My unit has been floundering now for over two months with no solution in sight. If you purchase one of these units give it a vigorous work out with as many routers as you can while still being able to return it for refund if you have a problem.

226,"There have been a number of great and detailed reviews so far, so I will be short:Great for play - For me, first and foremost, it is a tablet that does not need to be held to stand (my primary use case is browsing the web or watching videos in bed).  I am happy to trade down on the quality of the screen and ""touch"" for something than can stand on its own and is more effective at multitasking.Great for work - The keyboard and trackpad, the robustness of Chrome make it a great small laptop.  I already primarily work through a browser so to me the difference with a mac or a PC is minimalBottom line - At $250, it is cheaper than a tablet with similar screen size and is good for play (what I use a tablet for) and work (what I can't use a tablet for).  If you think about it, It is really a similar value prop vs. Microsoft Surface (a tablet that you can use for work as well).  Except that it is 1/3rd of the price.

227,"Please, understand what you're buying before you purchase a Chromebook. For anyone that does understand this, no one should rate this under 4 stars. I would really give the Samsung Chromebook 4.5 stars, because it's not perfect, but pretty darn close. As all the other reviews said, it is to surf the web, watch movies, get emails and other small work documents done very, very fast and smoothly. The time it takes to turn this computer on/off and sign in is under 10 seconds The keyboard is flawless, and the mouse/touch-pad is great (although I wish it was just a tiny bit more sensitive). It [keyboard] looks, feels and operates like Mac, if you're into that/care. Since I got my chromebook, I use it all the time and rarely touch my ""real computer."" I've recommended it to friends and family and would buy again if anything went wrong. Such a great great product for the price!

228,"I love the size and responsiveness.  Nice to open the cover and have instant access to the internet.  I had no problem transitioning to Chrome as I have used Chrome for years on my PC.  I am now learning to store files in the cloud and access them from both my Chromebook and my PC.  I will probably continue to use both my Chromebook and PC until adequate programs are available for Chrome.  My biggest problem is Quicken for finances.  Intuit has purchased Mint and made it available on Chrome but Mint requires you to provide your bank and investment accounts to function.  I'm not going to do that.  A couple other finance programs are available but are either too involved or don't provide the simple account tracking that I enjoy with Quicken.  All in all, I would definitely recommend this computer.  It works for me.

229,"I bought this Chromebook to replace my dead HP laptop and it has worked out pretty well. Price was a huge factor steering me towards Chromebooks but I think they would be perfectly sufficient for many computer users. I think many people don't realize they could save a ton of money with a Chromebook and be inconvenienced very little or not at all.Many reviews of Chromebooks point out the limitations of working on your stuff without an internet connection. I actually haven't found that to be a problem at all. You can enable offline access which allows you to edit documents stored in Google drive and create new ones. I cannot send anything/read email without an internet connection but that issue would apply with any laptop.The downsides are that sometimes the wi-fi is a bit slow, especially for streaming video and searching Amazon. I don't know if the slowness is caused by my wi-fi connection or if that is just a limitation of the Chromebook. One other issue: I occasionally need to use Skype which doesn't work with the Chromebook for the moment.But for 99.5% of what I need to do.....read email, surf the web, read other blogs, spreadsheets, photo editing, blog editing, youtube, it is pretty good. Sometimes the screen is a bit small for some sites/tasks. This can be a hassle when working with photos....but then again, I have had difficulty doing the same tasks on a 17"" desktop.There is a small learning curve to get used to Google docs instead of MS Office. But it isn't a major problem. There is lots of help within Chromebook's 'Getting Started' info. and in all the Chromebook applications.Major pluses: no virus concerns whatsoever, no hassle with all the security system prompts, scans, no downloading new updates, etc., etc. No waiting for my computer. It is ready for me! Regarding the instant on feature - I would say it takes a few seconds, maybe 10 sometimes. I would wait 100 times longer for my HP laptop if it was updating. Sometimes longer.Portability - because the screen is only 11"" and the design is so slim, this thing is pretty portable. Not as portable as a tablet but much better than the bulky 14"" HP laptop.Screen glare - mostly non-existent. This is another plus compared to my HP. It isn't as good as some eReaders but it is workable. With my HP, I would struggle to eliminate background reflections so much that it was largely unusable outside. The Samsung Chromebook is much better in this regard. I don't think that is true of all Chromebooks though. Some do reflect a lot.Occasionally when I travel, I am in an area with few wifi cafes and that is a hassle since I cannot access email. It would be to great to have the wifi embedded so I can get online anywhere and not be dependent on my home wifi or a cafe connection. I don't know if that is even possible on this kind of device. However, the vast majority of the time, this is not an issue.Updated February 8, 2015:I read lots of reviews to get an idea whether or not this would suffice as my only personal computer. If you are nervous about letting go of MS Office like I was, I can report that I have not found that to be a big issue. Google docs works much the same, and for the few differences, you can find out how to do the same functions either through Chromebooks' help info. or simply through a Google search. I actually to not have to share files with MS Office users all that often, but when I did, I was able to figure out what to do. If you have limited funds to invest or if you just don't want to overspend, a Chromebook is worth your consideration. For many, many users, it will satisfy all your computing needs.Owning and using a Chromebook makes me think that many people are wildly overpaying for computing technology when they buy a Windows or Apple laptop.

230,"The good: The Samsung Chromebook is gorgeous, incredibly light, It starts up almost immediately. The screen is bright and sharp. It has great battery life, and much better sound that most laptops or tablets that I've used. The keyboard is easy to type on, and the track pad is okay. Best yet, unlike conventional Linux-based systems, the Chrome browser in which everything runs supports both Netflix and Amazon streaming video. With multiple memory card and USB slots, it's more expandable than one would expect in a device so closely associated with Google (which seems to have declared 'death to the SD card' in the Android world).The bad: The CPU is under-powered, the Mac style buttonless-trackpad drives me nuts (fortunately my Bluetooth cordless mouse works fine), and memory can get awfully tight if you've got a lot of Chrome extensions/apps loaded or a lot of tabs open. This becomes evident when you from a tab in which you're streaming audio or video from Amazon or Google or whoever, and the audio playback cuts off for a second or two due to some combination of a CPU overload or frantic memory swapping on the OS's part. Access to Gmail, Google Drive, Google Docs, etc. is great, the Chrome web store is full of free and interesting, if not always useful, apps and extensions, and there are more numerous and more capable Chrome-based apps on the way, but nevertheless there are still significant holes in the application lineup. For instance, I need a working Citrix client to connect remotely to my office computer, and while there is a Citrix client for the Chromebook, my experience--and that of dozens of unhappy reviewers in the Chrome web store--is that it just does not work.Bottom line: I figured out pretty quickly that the Samsung Chromebook wasn't  going to replace my laptop or my development system, and while I expected that, it was still somewhat disappointing. On the other hand, it is rapidly replacing my tablet for activities such as reading my newsfeeds before heading off to work in the morning, or reading through my email. Having a real keyboard trumps a pretty tablet display any day in my book. and all of the apps that I consider essential on my tablet have web-based interfaces, most of which are more powerful than their Android app versions. So , while this Chromebook won't replace your full-featured PC, it can still serve as a terrific tablet replacement or alternative,

It is best used as a laptop replacement when traveling or when you just don't want to lug a more expensive and heavier computer around. The chromebook is very light, seems well built and has very good battery life. I got 6.5 hours when using the track pad and about 5.0 hours if I used a wireless mouse. It boots in about 10 seconds, and is completely quiet. It has two usb ports. One is usb 2.0 the other 3.0. The 3.0 port will also allow you to plug in an ethernet adapter if you don't want to use or don't have wi-fi available. It also has a SD card reader on the side for viewing photos etc. or extra storage. Also, there is a webcam at the top of the screen. If you haven't used the ""Chrome"" browser, it's very easy to use. If you're looking for something more like a conventional laptop than a tablet, especially for internet use, I think you'll be very pleased with the chromebook. Especially for this price.

Chromebooks are amazing computing machines, but Samsung products are terrible (at least their recent stuff).When I first turned it on there was a dead pixel on the screen, which then led to others. Then, as I was communicating with Samsung Customer Service, the keyboard and trackpad stopped working. I contacted Amazon and they gave me a full refund.Sure, one could say that this may have been a lemon, but all of my recent Samsung purchases (minus the disc drive) have been like this. Also, my Acer Chromebook worked flawlessly from day one, so there is no excuse for so many problems with this model right from the beginning.Avoid this product at all costs.

It does reboot quickly and you don't lose anything, but it's annoying.  I like the size of it, and it has been good for what I use it for.  I like being able to sit away from my main computer and use this for Facebook, gmail, etc.  I like the Chrome OS, haven't had any problems with that.  I wouldn't buy another one unless they figure out this crashing thing.  Yes, I should have called, but by the time I was annoyed enough to do so, it was probably past time to have anything done, and according to the other reviews, Samsung hasn't exactly owned up to the Chromebooks crashing like they are.

I get all the stuff I love about Chrome in a form factor that allows for great productivity.The portability of the computer is very helpful to me. I have two small children and I'm constantly having to stand up/sit down/stand up...etc. I can easily sit in my chair using this device and then stand up, carrying it in one hand.The battery life is on par with the specs, about 6 hours. It always has enough charge to use it without having to plug it in.I deducted one star for a few minor hiccups. I've had it for about 6 weeks and 2 or 3 times, when I boot it, the mouse cursor is gone. I have to reboot it, sometimes one than once to get it back. But rebooting takes about 15 seconds, so it's no big deal. Also, ironically, it has trouble scrolling on Google+. It's very slow to respond on that page. I don't know why.I would recommend this machine for anyone who wants to leave their full-fledged computer behind and be untethered by power cords and network cables, while still being able to write and email with the comfort and precision of a keyboard an mouse.

237,"I'll start with my complaints since there are only two of them:The trackpad doesn't have actual buttons for right or left click. Instead the whole bottom of the pad acts like a button when depressed. It's a bit clunky and hard to get used to for anyone who's accustomed to a conventional trackpad/button setup since it's harder to know where your hand is on the trackpad and it takes more effort to press it (thumb clicking for instance is not easy). Also a ""delete"" button would be nice (they have the power button where a delete button would normally go). Not huge things, but they do effect comfort level and how easy it is to transition to the machine. A back-lit keyboard would have also been nice, but that's getting into nit-pick territory and I probably only care because my laptop has one.Everything else about it is really nice. I bought it for my mother after the family desktop finally bit the dust. She is a computer novice to say the least. She knew how to check her bank account and write a Word document. The learning curve for the Chromebook wasn't very step for her. It took about an hour to set up a gmail account for her and to show her how to do things; she hasn't had any questions since. Setting up my own profile on the machine took about a minute. If I were setting up a home network, I'd get one for each computing person, a wireless external HD, and a USB optical drive and would probably end up spending only as much a one decent laptop would cost. The screen isn't as good as my Dell XPS15z but it more than does the job for casual computing (haven't streamed any movies yet). Battery life was about as advertised after barely any exercise. So was the unit's weight (it is light, but not without a nice, solid build). Speed is not a problem either and the OS appears as stable as windows 7.Best thing I could say is that if I had to make the choice again with what I know now, I'd buy the Chromebook again.Update: I currently have 8 tabs open in Chrome and it's still working fast. I have streamed some shows and the screen looks just fine (granted they were cartoons like Southpark, but they looked sharp). Plus I've found a slight fix to the lack of a delete key (alt+backspace).

The keyboard is full sized and like the one I'm used to working on on my Mac.  It's great.  I bought the first Asus EEE netbook when it came onto the market years ago and it's almost laughable how much better my Chromebook is.  And it was cheaper!  I think it's also a great candidate for someone who is not tech-savvy who just wants to surf and check email, since all security updates are automatically downloaded and installed when you power it on.

239,"So I think the biggest issue with chromebooks is the printer issue.Currently chromebooks can print directly to newer printers that support cloud printing, but ours doesn't so I had to try the alternative approach which requires a separate mac or pc. I went through the steps on my mac to configure the printer and share it with my son's account so that he could print. For some reason I couldn't get it to work (but was able to follow the steps pretty easily), he still could not print.  So ok, maybe that is just a technical issue that can be resolved, but read below.Also it is unclear but I'm fairly certain this other computer (used to configure the printer) has to actually be on and in the house. So that is a big drawback especially since my printer is a laptop I carry with me. So the chromebook could be home and I could be out and my son won't be able to print (even if we solved the technical issue in paragraph 1).So bottom line is that printing is an issue. To get around this, for a paper my son had to hand in at school, he wrote it on his chromebook, shared it with me via Google docs and I opened it on my mac and printed it. Not ideal.Still I'm giving it 4 stars since printing isn't done that much these days and in general it is working well for my son and his school assignments which he does on Google Docs.

It is great for writing college papers. It has access to Outlook.com and is compatible with Office Online. So, students can write papers in native Word format, for free.Of course the machine is optimized for Google products. It is fast and easy to use. It feels like a Mac.Buy two or three. They really are a nice machine for cruising the web and working with cloud based applications.They are not a primary computer though. Think of chromebooks as a commuter car, vs. a semi truck. They serve their purpose very well. They are an inexpensive tool to access the web.

241,"1st off, this is dead quiet which is awesome and very little heat is felt on your lap. The laptop is very light and easy to carry. Trust me when i say this blows away anything other laptop just because there is no noise, no hard drive clicking etc and very little heat in a very lightweight laptop frame. You will be ruined for any other laptop.Also this things is responsive and fast, although it doesnt seem like you can do much more than web browsing its not the case, you can use VPN, remote desktop which is easy to use and you can basically see/control a work desktop from this.I work in IT and can use this thing to configure cisco routers and ssh. Does everything i want and its fast with no boot up time which is just awesome :)

242,"The Samsung chromebook is sleek and very efficient. I use it for college purposes, when I type my papers I will save it in Google docs and also email myself my document and later save it to my Word document. Many folks complain about how the chromebook not having a delete key and honestly, who cares, just push backspace if you need to fix something, in my opinion it works the same way. If you have an account with Google then it should be pretty simple to use everything that is offered by Google. It holds a battery for 6 hrs, and it charges super quick. This product is worth investing in. My husband couldn't understand why I had to have this chromebook but then I saw him a several times on my Samsung chromebook. And then he told me he likes my chromebook. Overall great product! I am happy with it. It is great for school!! Give it a chance, if you don't like then return.

243,"I have always had Microsoft windows, so I am getting used to this. It took a little while to figure out how to use it, but once I caught on, it got much easier. I do like this computer and feel that I got a lot for my money. Unfortunately, it won't let me download firefox which is a requirement for a lot of my homework since it is the browser that supports my school's  web services, but since I graduate college next month, this is not too much of an issue. It also does not support java, and since I am not a tech wiz, I can't figure out how to bypass this. I am learning that this computer is very picky about what it will let me download. The screen is small and so is the keyboard, but it doesn't give me too many problems using it, and the screen is clear and has a good level of brightness. I love that it has an HDMI port and an SD card port, and I can even use netflix on it. I was concerned about this, because I read in a lot of reviews that before, netflix was not supported on the chromebook, but I tried it myself and it works fine now. The computer is very light and thin, which is kind of nice. Hopefully the body will last as well as other heavier computers. The built-in webcam takes good, clear images. Another drawback is that there is no DVD player in it, but there is really no room for one considering it is so thin. All in all, I do like this computer. The biggest issue, like I said, is that I wasn't expecting that I would have so many issues trying to download things. All in all, I give this an 8/10. If you are looking for something inexpensive to use primarily for internet use, I would recommend this. If you are looking for something more for multipurpose online and offline use, I would recommend a different computer. If I were not graduating next month, I would return this and purchase a different computer simply because of the difficulty in downloading certain web browsers and addons that my school's online based learning site requires.

244,"I'm a grad school student that uses the Samsung Chromebook as my only computer.  It's great for doing all school work, including research, papers and presentations.  (If I must use Microsoft Office, I can do so on the Chromebook through SkyDrive.)  Since I already owned a wireless printer, I can also print directly from the Chromebook over my home Wi-Fi network.  Additionally, its light weight makes it great for stuffing into a backpack without weighing it down too much.Of course, there are differences in the Chromebook for those that are used to a Windows PC.  For example, the keypad doesn't have a ""right-click,"" and there is no ""delete"" button.  Another difference is that with the Chromebook the user doesn't have to install, run or update virus protection software...ever.  The protection is built in and updates automatically (I love this feature)!  Finally, it's fast.  It runs smoothly and restarts very quickly (about 10 seconds) after being powered down.  Also, the battery life is far beyond what I ever experienced with a Windows PC; I get over six hours of usage from my fully-charged Chromebook.Overall, it does take some getting used to, but it's a great computer.  It's fast, light, virus-free and a great value!

246,"I really liked it until the screen cracked seemingly on its own, less than a month after I got it. Apparently, this is a common issue, which I found out when searching for a screen replacement.  I was carrying it in a bag with three other laptops and a 10"" tablet, and they are all fine, so I really have no idea how it could have happened. I got a replacement. I had noticed that the keys were leaving imprints on the screen, so I purchased some rubber feet and put them on the new laptop at the top of the screen bezel, hopefully this will prevent future problems. If I don't edit this review, it means the screen hasn't broken again...Aside from that, it's a very interesting machine. The performance is very good, especially with a single browser window it seems much more responsive than regular laptops of comparable price. The picture quality of the screen is good, the keyboard is comfortable, and it's very quiet due to the lack of a fan. I bought it more for purposes of having an ARM machine to play with, and as far as that goes it's probably the best option - it's very accommodating to developers.

247,"I love my new chromebook, I have had it about a month now. I needed something for school that I could take to class to take notes, access documents, and use spreadsheets. This little bugger is very comparable to the macbook air at about a fourth of the sticker price. Some say that this is only good for surfing the web but I have found it has been great for productivity - you just have to familiarize yourself with google drive. Before this computer I always used microsoft office. But I have actually come to like google docs and sheets so much more. Being connected to the cloud means never having to worry about losing a usb thumbdrive and updating your documents and spreadsheets anywhere. Not to mention google docs, sheets, and slides  work flawlessly with their microsoft counterparts - so no worries about sharing files with others.This thing is great for travel and streams netflix wonderfully. The screen is not a beautiful retina display by any means but for my purposes it looks great and gets the job done. I actually enjoy watching netflix on my chromebook and think it looks pretty good. The speakers on this puppy are amazing though, crystal clear and loud. You could even set this up in your room to listen to music. I was very impressed with this thing's sound system. This laptop is thin and sleek and has a quality build. The keyboard and track-pad is top quality and feels great for writing long documents. Really if you are a student or a professional i would recommend this laptop any day over any other tablet - its so much easier to get work done.There are some downsides, the keyboard is not backlit so when it's completely dark its pretty hard to see (however most people should have the keys memorized and not stare at the keys so this isn't a problem for me - home row for the win). Being so inexpensive the laptop is not metal but plastic, so it is very prone to scuffs and marks. You can't download a lot of software for this thing and downloading/managing music and other files not not the easiest. These issues don't really bother me because I was well aware of these things when I bought it. The only thing I would like to see change is for there to be a snipping function like in windows - very useful in productivity.Pros:Amazing keyboard and track-padVery slim and sleek (looks great)Outstanding speakers (for its size)Very fast and responsiveInstant bootNetflix runs wellGood productivity, compatible sharingCons:Non backlit keyboardPlastic build (scuffing)Not really made for extra softwareOther file management (like Music) not the best

248,"This is an fine system for a person who usually has WiFi available and whose main needs are satisfied by an Internet browser.  The good news is that there is really no user maintenance for the operating system.  No file backups, anti-virus worries, software patches etc.  As a small laptop, you have a well constructed unit, with a bright and sharp screen, low weight, 6 hrs of battery, etc.The bad news (for some) is that you're completely tied to Google's infrastructure, using Google Drive for cloud storage, dependent on their app store for any applications.  You need a good Internet connection (maybe 3 Mbs) for reasonable performance with files. There is a pretty good set of office software in Google Apps, but not as full featured as MS Office or LibreOffice/OpenOffice.  Another negative is that you can't easily tie it into your existing home network.  There is a procedure that allows you to print, but you have to run special server software on a friendly PC unless you have one of the latest e-print capable printers.

249,"Ask my wife. I've mentioned how much I love my new Chromebook every day since it arrived. Now, I'm a guy who tinkers with Windows PCs and an occasional Linux box. Before I retired from teaching, I learned the Apple ecosystem at school. I'm not into touchy-feely. Maybe that's why I haven't made the leap to smartphones and tablets.But my Chromebook gets me almost there...and fast! I can open this baby up and check my Gmail before you can say WinTel twenty times. O.K., maybe twenty-one. In terms of productivity, I had been slowly yielding to the gravitational pull of the Google ecosystem. The Google apps make creating, storing, sharing, and collaborating easy. My Chromebook seems a natural extension of Docs.Specs. I haven't mentioned that my Chromebook is light enough to take practically anywhere, and I use it on and off all day and charge it at night. YouTube videos? Of course, but don't plan to stream NetFlix.Buying my Chromebook for $249 may have been the best IT move I've ever made. Is it time to update all those basement boxes again?  Might take the feather duster down with me tomorrow.

250,"I purchased this for my husband because basically all he needs from a computer is to browse the internet and type documents.  I  am the one that would solve all the issues with our Windows computers and figured at least I wouldn't have to leave what I was doing every time he had a problem on the PC. Also, I had already decided to switch from Sugarsync to Google Drive to back up all of my files online, mainly because I can watch my home videos directly from the cloud which I couldn't do with Sugarsync. So, the 100 GBs of free storage that comes with Chromebook basically almost cut the price in half for me (a $120 discount considering the current $5 monthly price for that storage). Now, I have found myself using this thing every chance I get when my husband is not.I have an Android tablet that is great for some things, but I love having a real keyboard for writing and communication.It is really terrific for 95% of our needs, although for now a PC is still necessary for certain software. But personally, I'm fully behind Google Apps as a replacement for Microsoft Office programs. In any case, I don't see why any family needs more than one full OS desktop, be it Mac or Windows, that can be shared by all. Chromebooks are so inexpensive,every family member can have one for personal use.

I opened it up when it arrived and discovered the a key had fallen off and I fixed it. My son received his gift on Christmas day and was so excited he began to use it immediately but the key was sticky.  It has subsequently fallen off a number of times and now the Shift key is also not working. Overall the Chromebook seems to work well and it's nice and light but the construction of the keyboard is flimsy. He has used it for three weeks and this is happening and now I cannot return it because I bought it 4 months ago. Unfortunately that is what happens when you order well in advance for Christmas. I am going to follow up with Samsung to see if something can be done to repair the Chromebook or replace it.

This has to do with the licensing from dolby to chrome for the codec. The video plays fine but there is no audio. .avi and .mp4 works fine for me and i would recommend a ethernet to usb adapter in case you need to hard line connect.

253,"I bought this for my wife after realizing that she primarily uses the laptop for email, web browsing, and the occasional word doc and/or excel spreadsheet. Anything beyond that we use my laptop, with editing software for various media and so on. The Chromebook provides the basic needs we identified, plus it has the option of using apps from the google play store to provide further functionality. It's super lightweight, small, thin, very portable, and quiet- no fan! It's got limited storage on the HD, so if she needs to download something until we can transfer it to my computer, we're good- but google drive provides plenty of storage in the cloud, so that's not really an issue. All in all, it's a great option for day-to-day computer users who don't require higher-end processing power.

It is not going to do everything that a Windows computer can but for the price you shouldn't expect it to. If you need a good second computer for work or, like me, for a school computer you can't do much better. I would highly recommend this product!UPDATE:After using this lovely device since October I get more and more impressed with it. First off I love the fact that the updates are quick, painless, and come right from Google. Second, it handles a drop pretty well! I, of course, don't recommend you trying this at home, but it took a fall from waist height and landed right on the lid. It got scuffed up pretty good but the darn thing keeps ticking! No rattles or anything. Lastly now that it supports Netflix it makes a great addition to an HD TV.

255,"I'll start by saying yes there are a few things I miss, lack of functionality with some Microsoft products, and less computing power, but once you get over those things you will find a really nice piece of hardware for a really amazing price. I've had my Chromebook for 5 months now and it has been great for traveling, bringing to work, or even just throwing in the car to take around town. The screen is a great quality for me and allows me to watch Netflix and other movies with no noticeable degrade in quality. The keyboard is very tactile, the camera is also great for cam chatting. It is very light, and loads up really quickly so definitely good for someone who is on the go, not to mention the battery last a surprisingly long time.

256,"This is a fantastic notebook for a college student on a budget. It starts up quickly, is extremely light and portable, runs cool, and boasts incredible battery life (I've been getting 5-6 hours with a full charge). I was worried the keyboard might feel somewhat cramped because of the Chromebook's small size (I've found this to be a major drawback of other notebooks <13 inches), and was happy to find this was not the case.It's easy to use, intuitive, and the trackpad is excellent (really enjoying the two-finger scrolling). Most everything is run in the Chrome browser, with the Google equivalent of the Office suite and Gmail running offline. Reliance on a wireless internet connection has been widely criticized as a drawback, but with how widespread free wifi and personal hotspots have become, I don't personally have an issue with that.If you're considering the Chromebook, it's important to understand that it is not intended to be a replacement for a full-size laptop (and certainly not a desktop computer). It's $250, and that's just not its purpose. I'm an art student who also works part-time in web development, frequently running Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and Dreamweaver, so for all intents and purposes I'd be considered a ""power user."" I do not use the Chromebook for those tasks. I do use it for writing, internet browsing, and note-taking, and I can bring it along with me to school. So, if you're looking for extreme portability, good (though basic) functionality, and impressive battery life, this should be an excellent fit.

257,"So I've been looking at this Chromebook for a few months now, after someone at work (I work in IT at school) brought one in. I did a lot of research and read a lot of reviews, and finally purchased one after I got some extra spending cash and a credit card. I bought this for school and of course personal use, and it's absolutely perfect--in regards to what I thought it would be and what it can do.First off, disregard reviews from customers who are unsatisfied with the limitations of the Chromebook. If you didn't know it couldn't do something you desired, it's on your part; you should have done research into what exactly a Chromebook can and can't do.So yes, it's essentially a quick and simple computer that goes online. I'll be using this for writing papers, and doing all online related work for school. Quick shotgun of my personal assessment: very fast boot-up time as expected, keyboard is fantastic (very Mac-esque, one of the few things I like about macbooks), battery time is great, display is great (really), haven't tested the camera yet, trackpad could be better (at times, it's a bit off but not a big deal and it's working fine now), sound is great, build quality is great.Anyway, feel free to shoot any questions you may have about the Chromebook. I love Google and all, but I'm not biased enough to disregard the truth of any flaws.Edit - Random miscellaneous things: headphone needs to be pushed in very firmly into the jack, bottom of laptop gets warm/hot but definitely nowhere as hot as a normal laptop with a standard processor.

It is so small I have to keep a magnifying glass handy.  The web page sizes can be increased by any percentage.  There is no delete key, so you have to ""alt"" + ""backspace"" to delete. There is no ""Caps Lock"", shortcut is: ""alt"" + (the magnifying class icon),  This is a toggle command. This is very inconvenient if you have to type numerous acronyms or other titles mixed in.  If you are switching from a Windows or MAC PC, get an aftermarket guide book like ""Chrome Book"" or ""A Newbies Guide to Chromebook"" from Amazon.  That will save a bunch of headaches.

261,"***Updates To My Review At The End***My background: I'm a gadget geek but I'm not super devoted to any platform. I do love Google's web products but never used their hardware. My laptop is a 13"" MacBook Pro and my desktop is a Mac Mini that runs both OS X and Windows 7 (I spend more time on Win 7 these days). I have an iPad (3rd gen) and Motorola Droid Razr Maxx along with a docking station. My wife has a Win 7 ultrabook, Kindle Fire HD and Razr Maxx, all of which I purchased for her.I'm an editor for a web-based publication so my usage is primarily writing and some light (very light) image editing. I've done most of my writing on Google Docs for a long time because it automatically saves and I hate writing directly into the CMS. We also use Google Apps Business for e-mail, calendaring and doc sharing so that rocks.The last thing I need is another computer but Chromebook called to me. A couple of reasons:- The docking solution wasn't great. The keyboard was crap, my phone got unusually hot and interacting with the CMS was hit and miss with the phone OS. It was good for e-mails.- An iPad with a keyboard is garbage. I've tried it and hit the same issues. It is just clumsy for my primary work. I still travel with an iPad because it is light and its battery is a rockstar and can do in a pinch.- The laptop is fine but it is a beast to carry. I just got back from a week-long jaunt to three conferences and I think my shoulder is broken from my shoulder bag.- I love my phone and tethering has been a lifesaver. No complaints.Okay, enough background. Now to the actual review.Unboxing wasn't particularly impressive but I don't really care. Standard laptop box with the laptop, an AC adapter and Chrome sticker. I plugged it in and it was at about 75%. Now about an hour later, it is nearly charged.When I pulled it out of the box, it almost felt like a laptop that didn't have a battery in it (remember that?). Anyway, it feels solid closed up. I don't have any problem throwing this in my engineer's bag and feeling like it will get screwed up. The AC adapter is your standard black box with two cords.I opened up the lid and it started immediately. It asked me to connect to my wifi connection and then proceeded to download the latest update of the operating system (version 23 according to the info in Chrome). After a quick reboot, I put in my Google credentials and it loaded everything I use in my Chrome browser normally, including my apps and bookmarks.Opened up, the build quality showed a few weaknesses but nothing major. There's a little give on the keyboard and palm rest. I didn't feel any problems holding the laptop from its corner. It feels very solid overall. The thing to remember, of course, is that I came from a unibody MacBook Pro so take that for what it is worth.The keyboard blew my expectations away. I figured it would be fairly cramped and that my typing speed would suffer. I figured the action wouldn't be very good either. But, coming from a MacBook Pro chiclet keyboard to this was a cinch. I feel very little difference in typing speed or accuracy. This was really a big deal for me. I tried the HP Mini a few years ago and it was awful. A few millimeter difference is it.The trackpad is very good though not as top notch of a comparison as the keyboard. It is very Mac-like in using it. The two finger swipe gestures, right-clicking, dragging, etc... it all operated like I expected. I'm a tapper, not a clicker so that may have something to do with it. It doesn't seem like it is quite as accurate or response as the MacBook Pro but still very good.The screen isn't great but it isn't a dealbreaker. For text, it performs adequately but not spectacularly. For video, it is quite adequate, maybe above average but again, not fantastic. The screen brightness isn't what it could be, I feel like it is a tick or two off what should be standard brightness. But, I am also used to glossy screens and even with the brightness, the matte screen seems to do okay. I work right next to south-facing windows and even though we have no sun here in Seattle, it gets fairly bright and it seems good in these conditions. The viewing angles aren't going to impress anyone but it works for me.The speakers seem to be pretty good and loud enough. They are optimal for use on a desk rather than a lap though as the sound gets muffled a bit by clothing. I put on Pandora One and the sound through my nice $100 studio headphones sounds pretty good with the top volume topping out just right. Using my Apple headphone/mic combo, it worked well in a hangout. One thing is that the headphone jack seems very tight.I hit my first snag when I tried to do HDMI out. It didn't seem to work. Then I read a bit more and got it to work with the Ctrl+Full Screen and that seemed to do it. Depending on your monitor, your results may vary. It actually looked great on my LCD TV (including sound) but the resolution needs to be adjusted. It didn't look good (ironically) on my Samsung 21 inch monitor. There might be some settings I'm missing on either side but it's not a huge deal. Testing the video on the 1920x1080 HDTV, it worked great other than the overscanning.The camera is something that Monet would appreciate. You'll get the gist of it but this is no HD cam. It is good for basic pictures and compares unfavorably to the front-facing camera on my Droid Razr Maxx.After an hour of use off the charger, the heat situation is non-existent. This thing is creepily quiet and cool to the touch except for a few warmer spots. I will end up watching a movie to see how it reacts but that would be a nice change. Even my iPad gets warmer.I had no opportunity to try out the bluetooth or the SD card reader. I will be getting a 32 GB SD card. I did try out a USB drive and it seems to be working just fine.Getting into the software and how it drives on the ARM processor, I was pretty impressed. I opened about 18 tabs (which is well beyond my max, typically) and I had Pandora running in the background the entire time and didn't get a stutter. At times, the load was sluggish but again, I am switching between this and a MacBook Pro with 8GB of RAM and a dual-core i5. But I really expected this to be flawless when using the web. As long as you don't go crazy with tabs or the apps you are driving in them, you should be good.Watching videos, outside of the screen quality, was really quite smooth. From someone who bought the original Kindle Fire and saw it stumble with streaming video for just $50 less, I was super-impressed. I don't know if power-users will love it but it works with my slightly-lowered expectations.That being said, this is a web enabled device and there are a few (very few) apps that I use regularly.My stand-alone apps that I use regularly is chat (Google and AIM) and Tweetdeck. Both Tweetdeck and imo seem to work pretty good in a browser. If anyone has any suggestions, let me know.I also know that Skype doesn't work great right now. I am using it through imo but, at least as far as I can tell, I can't make dial-out calls like the Skype app allows on all of my other devices. This, including no support for a USB headset, would make it tough to make this a full-time replacement. I live on Skype as a dial-out provider (Google dial-out will not allow me to use certain conference call providers plus Skype is great for connecting with people worldwide with ease). I'm hoping a promised webapp version is coming soon. On the plus side, Skype works great on my cell and iPad.I turned off the wifi connection and it worked liked it should. You need to turn on offline mode in Gmail and Google Drive in order for it to work but after that, it worked like it always has. Games that I had loaded for offline mode worked. Offline, this is a pretty limited machine but not unduly so.Chrome remote desktop worked particularly well. Granted, I was using it on the same network but there was no lag on the software side of using it. I was, again, thoroughly impressed with the graphics. Though, one thing would be to allow me to select which screen I view when I am using a dual-display.I'm looking forward to Netflix capability but that's not ultra-critical right now for me. Amazon Instant works well for me, as does Hulu.I'm taking only this when I go on an extended trip this weekend so I can update more on real battery life and any other real-world experiences of using it later.Overall, this is what I expected and I am pretty happy with the purchase, especially as one of my first sight-unseen types of purchase. For my uses as a primary road writing device for blog posts and e-mails, this is a solid, solid play. And for $250, it's pretty unbelievable. All of this typed into the new Chromebook as well at my normal rate.== UPDATE 10/28/2012 ==Just took this thing on a weekend away without bringing my laptop. This is a big deal as even if I took my iPad, I would normally take my laptop as well. A couple of additional thoughts from 72 hours as my primary computer.I did end up getting a SD Card (a 32 GB one from Amazon) and putting it in the SD card slot. Unfortunately, it sticks out from the side pretty well (about a centimeter looking straight down on it). I loaded it with a few movies and some music so I would have some tunes and movies for offline. The player works fine but is very basic. Other than wishing the SD card would seat all the way in, it is a good setup for leisurely watching movies solo.I also did some extended work while my wife was driving. I typed two articles and I can't emphasize enough how good of quality this keyboard is. Even working it off of my lap, it performed beyond its price point.I typed those articles offline and using Google Docs offline worked as expected. When I reconnected, my documents synced up no problem. This worked exactly like it had on my MacBook Pro whenever I took it on a flight without wifi so no surprises there.Under normal use, the battery is probably going to be right there in the 6.5 hour range. Google could have pushed this spec. Working offline with the screen brightness at 50%, I was able to squeeze a little over 2 hours into 25% of battery life.Speaking of brightness, the ambient light sensor works pretty well. Maybe a little too good in the car as it would dim slightly as we went under overpasses on the freeway.The other thing I wanted to do is try out the some games. I played Angry Birds because I could compare it across all devices and the Chromebook is definitely lagging in performance. It was just a step behind and could be a bit choppy. I also tried the most popular game Entanglement and it seemed to perform well though it is simple. I also did a fantasy basketball draft on Yahoo sports and it was also a step behind.I'll also mention that the first time I loaded up Entanglement was the first time the Chromebook crashed on me. I don't imagine it will happen that often but the nice thing is that it recovered everything I had up in about 20 seconds. Also, it is the first time I noticed heat of any kind coming from the laptop at all. Not unusually hot but it will warm up some when going graphics and CPU intensive.In any case, I stand by my 4 star review. Even with some minor performance issues and a few smaller issues with quality, this is still an excellent purchase. An improved screen and battery life would make it easier to look past the sometimes-lagging performance. I won't be getting rid of my MacBook Pro but I am looking forward to taking this thing on the road and getting a good chunk of the functionality without the weight.== UPDATE 11/20/2012 ==After about a month more with regular usage, a couple more notes.After awhile, the Chromebook does warm up but not significantly. Again, I'm comparing this to other laptops. And really, you shouldn't be using a laptop on your lap anyway but some situations require it.Closing the screen instantly puts it to sleep but I definitely have found that you can't keep just putting this thing to sleep time after time and not expect any lag. Eventually, something I loaded would make the Chromebook freeze and I'd have to restart. I've learned to simply shut this computer down rather than close the lid and let it sleep. With near instant boot time, it's not a big deal but that's definitely a change.The keyboard on this thing is still a rockstar. Using it in poorly lit situations make me long for a bit of backlighting but I am really a touch typer at this point so it only slows me down when I am realigning my hands.No degradation in performance. I've watched probably 6-7 ripped movies on this thing with no problems and no internet connection. Looking forward to taking this to my in-laws for Thanksgiving instead of my MacBook Pro.== UPDATE 03/09/2013 ==I haven't updated in awhile so I thought I would. I still use the Chromebook on a regular basis and thanks to the regular updates to the system, this version of the Chromebook now has swap enabled (at least in the beta channel). For those unfamiliar, previously when the Chromebook would run out of physical RAM, it would just start dumping inactive tabs (so it would require a refresh). It would, at times, get a bit laggy with too many tabs open.With swap enabled, once you hit the top of your RAM usage, it starts using the hard drive as RAM. This means limited to no inactive tabs being dumped (I haven't seen one yet) and overall, faster usage under heavy workloads (10+ tabs).In short, this computer has actually gotten faster and better since my last update.A couple of issues still exist. Netflix still doesn't work. I've contacted Netflix and they say they are working on it. They've been saying the same for months though. Every other streaming service works (including Amazon Prime, Hulu and Comcast's streaming). If Netflix is a must and you don't have an alternative device (I use an iPad mini for it if I really need it), I wouldn't bet on this coming through anymore.I would like to see more gestures using the trackpad as well, The two finger scrolling is nice but the three finger nav (especially for back) helps a lot. I can use the keyboard back button too, yes. But switching between using a Mac and the Chromebook makes it especially unnatural. More gestures!There is a little bit of wear on the palm rests and some dings but nothing major as of yet. This thing still is great for writing (which is my primary use for it). It is so great and lightweight so it is easy to throw in a small bag for a day trip.Overall, still very happy and it is even better with the speed and stability improvements with swap enabled.== UPDATE 03/11/2013 ==Just a quick update since I just updated but Netflix now works. I've tried it and it has been confirmed by many other users. Again, this has been a big ding against both Netflix and Google for not figuring this out but now it is working.

262,"I absolutely love this thing, but this is information that I think is valuable when considering which Chromebook you want. There is software/online functionality available to the other Chromebooks (any of them that use an x86 Intel processor) that isn't available on the Samsung Series 3 Chromebook (ARM based processor), as of this writing (February 12, 2013). For example Netflix and Native Client, which is made by Google and allows Chromebooks to play some third-party games and programs, don't work yet on the Series 3 Chromebook. They promise they're working on it, so hopefully they'll be up soon and make this review irrelevant (please!).Also I had a temporary issue where the Chromebook would not wake up from sleep mode. I don't know what caused it, and I don't know what fixed it, but it works flawlessly now.

This little powerhouse powers up instantly when you open the cover, is password protected but my kids can browse on it as a guest. Pages load instantly. It holds a charge for a good 8 hours and charges quickly. I always been a fan of Chrome and I love the size and portability of it. Updates automatically and virus-free, Keyboard is great, mousepad works great. I did get a wireless mouse for when I'll be doing a lot of scrolling and clicking. Haven't looked into tying it into my wireless printer yet but there's a built in tutorial I""ll get to one day.

265,"I'm going to assume you already know what a Chromebook is and you don't need to be warned that there is no Windows or Mac operating system here. You're a Google power user and you're invested in the Drive/Gmail/GooglePlus/Chrome experience. You're not expecting this to look or feel like a Macbook Air (neither the display nor the trackpad are going to meet THAT expectation, but they are better than other ""netbooks"" you may have used).Just buy it. It's $249 bucks for a little portable laptop that has a baked in backup and sync plan. Anything you do on it out in the field can be pulled right back up from your main desktop Chrome browser. It turns on fast and it weighs about as much as a paperback book. Make sure you have plenty of Wi-FI or hotspot access because otherwise it's not going to do much for you (there are 2 USB ports, so you could plug in a Cellular data stick if you have one).One thing I'm still experimenting with is the output to external monitors. The graphics card is fast and clean enough, but perhaps not configurable to every external monitor you can think of. Sometimes it mirrors, sometimes it only displays on the external monitor. That's an HDMI cable connection, by the way.So, look... here's a little 11"" solid state netbook you can hand off to your younger kids and not have a heart attack everytime they're quiet for 30 seconds (there's a guest login account that will act like an incognito browser, without saving any settings or history). As of right now Google is giving out 100 GB of drive storage free for a couple years along with these... you redeem it through a ""Goodies"" window upon initial setup. You don't get to return the laptop and keep the cloud storage, though.Bottom line, it's a solid build of an excellent concept. Highly recommended for anyone looking for an affordable and portable answer to the question ""How can I carry my desktop browser capability into the field without lugging around a device that I can't afford to lose, break, or have ripped off.""

At a conference last week I moved from one area of the hotel with WIFI to another without WIFI and could take notes, without worry about battery or connectivity with notes going to Google drive.One complaint: the screen when pushed back to get a better view turns the screen off. Inconvenient as I often tilt the screen for better contrast. On that note, the screen is great when viewed at the right angle.Light weight makes it very easy to carry, instant on makes it the go-to machine among windows laptops, keyboard makes email reply and search simple and choice over tablet.

268,"This is my 4th Samsung Chromebook, so I must like this product. I use this chromebook as a 11.2 inch tablet with built-in keyboard that allows expanded capability. The keyboard is excellent and offers shortcut functions that rivals full PC. The touch pad allows gesture inputs with controllable sensitivity. Free 100 gb google drive storage for 2 yrs is also very nice and I take full advantage of it by downloading hundreds of camera pictures when I travel. One feature that needs improvement is HDMI connectivity to external monitors and TV. This feature, when it works, allows watching youtube videos or mirroring chromebook screen directly on large screen TV or monitors. But lately with new chrome updates, this function got messed up and I can't do it anymore. I hope Google fixes this soon. Otherwise, this chromebook is a neat idea and give many people to own a light-weight, low-cost pc.

269,"I just needed a small cheap computer and that is what I got.  I like it because it boots instantly just like my ipad.  I don't like it because it crashes regularly.  I looked up why this happens and found that it is a common problem and that the fix is complicated starting with deleting all the apps.  I went to a lot of trouble to download apps only to have to delete them.  It helped, but now I don't have the apps.I guess it doesn't matter that much because, like I said I wanted a computer and have found that most of the apps that I used are available by just typing in the name in the address bar which seems to double as google search.Bottom line, if you are looking for fabulous, don't buy this.  If you are looking for a compact quick (and I mean quick) computer, this will serve your needs.

271,"I recently purchased this chromebook with the intention of using it as a second PC.  I am pretty amazed at what it can handle since its only a 250 dollar machine.  The keyboard and the trackpad are excellent, the system is easy to use and if I cant do something within the chrome system I can easily remote into my home computer and do it there.  I can say with certainty that this has become my daily driver - its zippy and light and certainly beats totting around my macbook pro.  Google drive makes it easy to create excel, powerpoint and word docs and just about everything I need can be handled within Chrome.  Love it, best 250 I have spent and better than a netbook.

272,"I am enjoying my chromebook. I am not a ""computer"" guy just a regular user who surfs the web and creates documents. What I would recommend is using Google Docs if you are a Word user. Also install Google Chrome on your current device. Then the other throwback is there is not a delete button and the inability to copy/paste just using the right click. You have to use the control button. But after using for over a month this has become second nature. There are so many more pluses than negatives and the negatives are just adjusting. I would say go for it if your thinking of it. Plus are the making you use Google Drive thus can use anywhere, the storage of documents is in the cloud harder to use, password storage, the ease to carry, no virus needed, quick bootup,battery life, the whole Google system is cool, plus more. As anything it takes getting used to. I had for over a month and enjoy my chromebook.

When I traveled to a foreign country (in South America), for ""security"" purposes, gmail would not let me login. So I had to create another gmail account on my travel companion's laptop, and use that to login to my Chromebook. I then Googled how to solve the problem of gmail blocking login from foreign countries, and found the link to unblock but it didn't stick. In other words, I had to keep using my alternate login, and then keep trying the unblock link every time. Obviously this is not a hardware problem, but hopefully the Google guys will fix this annoying little problem which will effect people who travel.

274,"Last year I bought my Mom a Chromebook for Christmas. She, has loved using it, so this year I did a little research, and decided to order the arm based Samsung Chromebook for myself. It has been a joy to use, and must be one of the best values of 2012. Completely silent, cool running, and fast enough to do the job. For $250 it can’t be beat. Some have written that it is just a browser, and not useful, but they are flat out wrong. I use it everyday for all kinds of tasks, and find it very useful. It is not perfect, but it is very good, and will only get better with the automatic updates. As a bonus It also comes with 12 gogo passes to use on airlines that offer this service. I used it last week on a flight from Atlanta to Buffalo, and it worked great the whole way. I really like it a lot. As I said, though, it is not perfect. Here are a few of the things I like and dislike so far:Pros...-Silent (No spinning hard drive, no cooling fan)-10 second boot from off, 2 second resume from sleep-No anti-virus needed- Automatic OS updates-Plays Amazon instant video ( but not in HD)-Able to edit word documents offline-Read and create email offline (If you set it up)Cons...-File management still needs to be more flexible (no way to create folders in the sidebar)-No Netflix support for the arm version-Finish scratches easily-Right wrist-rest creaks at times.-Cannot edit spreadsheets offline (as of 1/17/2013)I'm sure I haven't explored all the features yet, but so far so good.

276,"I used to have a 17.3"" HP, which was the relative weight and size of a small tank. Taking that around on trips or to class was a pain. Eventually, the screen cracked, and I hunkered it down attached to a monitor, and decided to take a try at the Chromebook. Boy was I happy I made the purchase.Pros:1) Extreme Portability. This machine gets a solid 6 hours of battery life (tested it with internet usage, streaming Netflix) as well as being small and lightweight. It's 7 second power on time may be a little exaggerated, but it has never taken me more than 20 or 30 seconds to get on and running.2) Web-based platform. I was really concerned with buying a computer that I could only use on the web. The more I thought about it though, there's very few places that are around now that don't have some kind of wireless. In addition, you can still access your worksheets and docs offline, then they will be updated when you sign on.Cons:1) Size: Going from a bigger laptop like I had to this one wasn't easy. The screen size makes a huge difference when trying to do work that needs two windows open. Its not a deal breaker, but something to consider when looking into it.2) Performance: I read reviews for users who said that performance decreases with over 8 tabs open. I thought that was a ridiculous amount of tabs to have open. However, I find myself averaging around 8-10 at a time, and you can definitely see the performance lag when you have that many open. Closing them out and waiting a few seconds increases performance back to normal, just a little inconvenient.Overall, I've had the chromebook for 2 months now, and I am still in love with it.

The battery should last all day (5-7 hours on a charge).I use it like a tablet with a keyboard. I only shutdown once a day (at most). During the day, I just close the lid. That puts the machine in low energy ""sleep"" mode. I really, really, like being able to lift the lid and do things instantly. Small tasks suddenly make sense because there is no overhead. That's the part I love the most. Open it, it's on. Close it, it's in power-save mode.This one is lighter and sleeker than the CR-48 I was using. It only took about one minute to have all the same functionality on the new Chromebook that I had developed over three years of constant use on the old Chromebook. It was the simplest computer change I ever made.The device arrived quickly and in perfect shape.I'm still getting used to the chicklet keyboard.

281,"If you understand the hardware and software limitations of ChromeOS (the operating system that Chromebooks run), I think this one of the best bargains in tech.  While there isn't much horsepower under the hood, the components are a good fit for the ChromeOS vision.  Performance is snappy.  The form factor is small, light, and extremely portable.  I'm pleased with the build quality for the price (though it still won't compare with anything that costs 3x as much).  Touchpad works well and has some multi-touch functionality (e.g. 2-finger scrolling).  The keyboard has a well-designed layout (nothing really funky) and is comfortable to type on (comparable to the chiclet keyboard on my Vaio F Series as well as Macbook Air and Pro keyboards).I bought the Chromebook for grad school use in lieu of my 17 inch desktop replacement.  I'm a pretty heavy user of Google Drive (formerly Google Docs).  My use case is not tied to any software that requires a specific OS.  The Chromebook has been perfect for me for school use.  It's actually supplanted my Vaio for casual use when I don't need Windows-specific software or raw horsepower.  If you're interested in Ubuntu Linux, both Crouton and Chrubuntu are easy to install.While I love my Chromebook, there are areas which will hopefully be improved in successive models.  The screen is one of the lowest quality panels on any contemporary laptop.  This is expected at this price point, but it's the only thing that consistently reminds me that I'm using a sub-$250 device.  From an aesthetic standpoint, the hinge where the screen meets the laptop body is a bit ugly compared to higher-end laptops.  I'm happier that the hinge seems structurally sound and works well, but it is a small nitpick.Overall, I can't imagine being more pleased for such a low-priced computer.  There are definite limitations that should rule this computer out in many use cases, but it's a phenomenal value at what it does well.  If you're comfortable living almost entirely in the cloud, I don't know if there's a better value out there.  If you own a desktop or not-very-portable laptop and would like an ultraportable 2nd computer for light use, this Chromebook is a phenomenal complement.  If you want something cheap that won't be a disaster if it's lost, stolen, or dropped, $250 is about as little as you can pay for a computer.A little about myself:I'm a tech geek.  Between home and work, I've used a wide number of computers and devices.  I consider this Chromebook the best value of the devices I've owned.  For reference, I currently have a Vaio F series laptop (F1190x), a powerful custom-built desktop (i7-2600k @ 4.4 GHz w/ 2x 6970s), a Google Nexus 10 (10-inch stock Android tablet), an original Kindle Fire (7-inch tablet with Amazon's version of Android), and a Galaxy S4 (Android phone).

The kids can easily grab the computer to surf pbskids.org for hours without needing to recharge.  The only negative, and this is not that bid a deal for us, is that we did not know beforehand that Chrome uses ""Google apps"" instead programs.  The apps are easy to get, but they are all internet based and only available from the Chrome Store (many are free).  That means keeping the Lenovo for those occasions that we need to get pictures off the iPhones or to sync the Apple devices to iTunes...although a hard sync is rarely required since Apple has gone wireless.I will probably get another Chromebook if the kids abuse this one too much.

I would need to ask Amazon Warehouse Deals for the customer's 4 digit security code in order to transfer to me.  I thought to myself, good luck getting that. After two hours with customer support, neither Amazon nor Samsung could give me the code or offer a solution. Samsung just told me to reset my device to factory settings and sent me back to Verizon, who now said (code aside) they could open a new account, but the device had only had 19 months left of free wireless.

Goggle has so many optimized apps for the chromebook. So happy with this device, feather lite, so exceeded my expectations. So many off line apps to choose from, can watched Netflix, hulu or  youtube while chating with friends on facebook and still worked without a hic-up. The Samusung Chromebook is quiet and cool, will not heat up your lap even after hours of use. The keyboard keys are spaced perfectly with great keystroke response. Battery life is good, storage in the cloud makes file storage easy. USB Flash drives can also be used to view and edit photo's and music.

290,"I bought my ChromeBook a few months back.  It's still a rock-solid performer for what I use it for.  It's not for everybody, but for those who need to use a notebook for internet searches, report writing, news, weather, music or watching a movie...at this price, you can't go wrong.  It turns on instantly when you open the Lid and opens everything up quickly.I use Google Docs quite often on this machine on and offline without any problems.  I also use Google's offline tasks which frankly looks and works better than it's online version.  For those who say yeah but can you run Microsoft Office...I say yes you can.  if you have a Microsoft account (Live.com, Outllook.com, Hotmail.com) you can store Office docs, spreadsheets, PowerPoint slides and OneNote files within SkyDrive and open up natively with Microsoft Office for the Web.  Works great for me.There are only 2 things keeping this from a 5-star rating; 1) ChromeOS will get bogged down with too many tabs open.  That said, I generally don't have more than 5 open at any time..including media sites like Pandora, iHeart or YouTube.2) The built-in Web cam is a bit sub par with it's slightly low resolution but it works well with Google Hangouts.  Frankly I rarely use a web cam anyway so it's not that big a deal.For the price and it's ease of use, you really can't go wrong with this device.

291,"Let's start with first the service. As usual amazon surpassed my expectations by delivering my Chromebook a day before scheduled!! I got the best price I could find online with amazon. Have been a faithful customer for years and I don't see that changing anytime soon. Now as for the Chromebook, I would like to say that with this computer you want to be sure you know what your getting. I did my homework and researched for weeks before settling down to buy this laptop. I think its important to remember that this is all about the internet. I am fine ""living in the cloud"". but its not for everyone. I love the size, ease of use, and functionality of this laptop. I have to say I was worried about the keyboard with its lack of certain keys I'm used to but I have fallen in love with the search key!! I will be in the middle of reading something and want to research more and instead of opening a new tab and going to google I can just tap one key start typing and have a new window come up. I am very have with my purchase and would encourage potential buyers to do some research and take the leap into the cloud with this device. Happy shopping :-)

292,"This is a great, easy to use little computer. I find that I rarely need to use anything outside of Google Docs/Sheets, and Google Chrome offers plenty. It plays Netflix videos just fine, I use spotify web app for music, internet connection is fast, and connects quickly. I haven't felt the need to turn on my PC except for once when I was having trouble edit a .docx file. It is very light, and I get about 5.5 hours of battery life on a charge. It doesn't get warm during use, and it's easy to toss around and not worry too much about. I have some scratches on it already, but for $250, I don't feel so worried compared to when I use my girlfriend's $1300 macbook. It's not the fastest machine, and the tap to click on trackpad doesn't work so well on the upper half, I prefer to push for the audible click. Keyboard is fantastic, almost as good as my gf's mac. I am typing several Amazon reviews on this right now, and it's so easy to use and reliable.

294,"My 9 year old Toshiba laptop died recently. The hard drive crashed, it was in need of a new battery and fan (both for the third time) and the screen hinge had broken. I was not interested in either a Windows machine or a Mac. I bought a Samsung Chromebook and I'm very happy I did. I had already moved most of my music and documents to the cloud so the change was easy. In two weeks with the Chromebook I haven't missed the local apps that used to clutter up my machines (word processing, video editing, anti-virus, etc.). I open the screen on this thing and in a few seconds I'm on the web for email, Google apps (calendar, documents), games, Facebook, you name it. I have enough local storage on it to save various things but I haven't found the need to. I get about 6 hours of battery life, it runs cool all day, connects to all WiFi networks without incident. and the keyboard is a pleasure. Around two pounds to carry, it slips into my work bag and I hardly know it's there. The other day it did a system update in about 10 seconds. The fact that it is always up to date and virus free only adds to the advantages. Thanks Google and Samsung! As far as I'm concerned, you hit it out of the park!

Was a little worried reading some reviews about how slow Chrome was when multiple tabs were running......nonsense. I found no issues....I run Google music while browsing multiple pages with no issues at all. Need reliable WiFi internet connection at all times for this to give you full potential.I will say......If you are not currently in, or not planning on entering, the Google ecosystem this system isn't for you. I'll explain for first timers.....I have Android phones, Android Tablet, Google TV, Gmail, Contacts, Calendars, All music and movies purchased and saved in Google Music, Google Drive for all my cloud storage etc..... Everything is there on all devices by logging on your Google account. If you want to keep everything separate(hotmail, I tunes for music, amazon instant video or whatever else out there) this machine isn't what your looking for...stick with a PC.

297,"The Samsung Chromebook is thin, light, visually appealing, and a little...slow, at least by current Chromebook standards. This Chromebook is powered by an ARM processor that isn't as powerful as the one in the Acer c720 (a Chromebook that comes in at a very similar price point than this one). The Samsung Chromebook has been a travelers paradise; no longer do I have to carry around a honking 6lbs laptop or its heavy charger. The Samsung Chromebook gives me an average of about 6 hours of usage, which is more than enough for what I need to use it for away from home. It also provides these modest hours while being completely silent, a trait that can be attributed to the ARM processor inside, as well as the lightweight Chrome OS (which made running an ARM processor in the first place entirely possible).The keyboard is absolutely fantastic to type on and the trackpad is large and spacious. I was the type that would carry around an external mouse to be used for my laptop, big emphasis on WAS. Not only is the trackpad eons more responsive than on my Windows laptop, but it also works with some of Chrome OS's unique trackpad gestures. ChromeOS has a very short learning curve if you use Google Chrome as your primary browser on your current device and a moderate one of you don't. Most of what you do is through a web browser, which is what a lot of people are already accustomed to rather they believe it or not.The biggest issue i've seen people mention has been the inability to use Microsoft Office with the Chromebook. I've been using Google Drive (formally Google Docs) since I was back in a college and it has been an ample substitute to the familiar software I have grown up with. If you still prefer to use Microsoft Office, you can still go to the Office.com website on your Chromebook and compose documents online in a lightweight, free version of the software.Video playback on the Chromebook has improved, but what is holding it back, unfortunately, is the ARM processor inside of it Most of the time video playback is pretty good, but if you have multiple windows or tabs open, you can see noticeable frames being dropped during the video. This isn't a huge problem, but if you are going to be watching Netflix or Hulu on this machine, you might want to close a few tabs beforehand.Overall I think this was a fantastic purchase, especially for the price. The Chromebook is beneficial to a specific user in mind, but if you feel you might be that user, you can't really go wrong with a Chromebook. My recommendation as of March 2014 would be the Acer c720 since the price is comparable and it has an Intel Haswell processor that gives the Chromebook better performance and better battery life than the this Samsung model. Chromebooks do a fantastic job at covering the basics, and the basics are the only things many of us need anyway.

298,"I was looking for something really inexpensive that would give me a full web viewing experience(I also have an iPad 2.) I found out about this little laptop and took the plunge. I do not regret it at all! This computer boots up from completely off so fast!!! Of course you'll read in other reviews that this is an ARM based model and not an intel, so some webpages are not instant in loading, and I've got it to stutter while I'm listening to music in one tab and loading a web page in another tab, but for the price, I don't think it can be beat!!! There is also the popular Acer C7, but it has a fan and is a little more bulky.  I chose the Samsung because it's thinner, quieter(no fan) and has amazing battery life! If you're looking for a sub-$250 web only machine, this is a great choice!

299,"I purchased this as a replacement to my Sony Vaio since it finally had died on me. This is little laptop is great! The OS is a little confusing at first coming from a Windows but it's very easy to great use to. The battery life is great and this little guy is very energy efficient. I only needed this computer to surf the web and watch a few videos.  The only con of this computer is the lack of storage. You only get 16MB stored on the Chromebook itself and you get 100MB of online storage free. So in other words no iTunes :( This computer is great though despite it's one flaw. For $230, there is NOTHING that can stand close to this in value. On one last note I feel this would be great for any college student on a budget. It's extremely easy to haul around and very light. The online storage would be great for notes, projects, etc. The only other option than this would be to get a used computer (which I feel extremely uncomfortable with) or an entry level PC laptop which they usually tend to start around $400 and aren't very good. The only thing I'm not sure about is how long the computer itself lasts but fingers crossed. It's worth trying out, I recommend it.

It booted up really well and found the internet etc. It seems built pretty solid (the surface finish is odd, but that's just me).Our main computer, the old big box under the desk, had failed. This seemed like a reasonable replacement- we just needed a very simple computer for surfing and letter writing. But we also needed also to be able to print. I am sorry to say that this computer does NOT hook up directly to a printer. Instead it will print to a remote printer (that is, a printer on your OTHER computer or if you have a cloud printer).So we had to return it - not for us.But if you are just looking for secondary laptop this will do well.

I also get envious every time Windows has to take time updating and restarting on my systems compared to the automatic , no worry or notice updates from Google on the Chromebook.It took very little time for him to realize the benefits of using Cloud storage compared to hard drive storage, especially when he saw how nicely everything stayed in synch with his Android tablets.

307,"To begin, this laptop is not a normal laptop. There are no native apps which means no Microsoft Word, Office, Excel, no Adobe Photoshop, no software you download to the laptop itself. This laptop runs Chrome OS which means it essentially only runs the Chrome browser, so being connected to the internet is crucial to get the full functionality of this laptop. With that said, there is some use offline as well.I love this laptop. It does everything I need it to when I bring it to class with me. I use Google Drive to store all of the information from my classes. Since it doesn't run Microsoft, I export everything to the Google equivalent and it works fantastically. Other than PowerPoints not opening in Google Slides if they are over a certain size (which I remedy by using my library's computers to cut the presentation into two, then upload it to Drive). I collaborate with my lab groups using Google Docs, and all of the websites I need for homework (blackboard, mastering physics, reddit) run smoothly.The battery life (I usually get around 6 or 7 hours depending on how bright I keep the screen) combined with the small charger are great when I am on campus the whole day. I don't have to lug around my primary laptop (which is over 7 pounds) just to take notes, do problems, or write papers. It connects to the wireless at my school flawlessly (which can be a pain in especially crowded areas of my campus, and in places where my primary laptop has had trouble accessing the internet), due to the a/b/g/n connectivity capabilities. Also, my phone has free mobile hotspots, so I am able to connect to the internet using that as well while on the train to work on homework or projects.It is a light, portable, affordable laptop that packs a punch as long as you know what you're buying- a laptop that only runs a browser, and how to fully utilize the Google experience.Update: Google slides seem to be as to open larger documents now. Overall, I still use this laptop just about everyday. The only downsides are that I cannot find a good PDF editor to notate my textbooks with and one of my classes requires the use of flylab, which is java based and I cannot get to run on the Chromebook. My 5 star rating still stands as long as you know what you are buying when you buy this product.Update 2: Roughly 1 year and 9 months with this laptop and it still is awesome. The battery has not shown much wear and still lasts me through a day of classes. Even with the hardware becoming outdated, it is still able to handle my PDFs, PowerPoints, and Docs, both online, downloaded, and those accessed from my flash drive (which the laptop has had nearly no problems reading, or any I can think of, really), along with having multiple tabs open at once. I connect an HDMI cord from my TV to stream HBO, Netflix... etc in HD with no hiccups (and if you put the dimmer all the way down while connected and close the lid, it goes into docking mode for convenience and easier viewing- a cool little fact I appreciate). While I use my TV and dock the laptop, I connect a wireless keyboard and use my HD TV as, essentially, my monitor, and this little machine can handle all I throw at it. For the ~$250 dollars I bought it for, I could not be happier. The only things I have begun to notice is that my screen might be starting to wear out and the wearing down of the elements, but even at that, it's expected with the use I put it through. Also, I still cannot find a good PDF editor! The PDF viewer in Chrome is lacking some features I like that the PDF viewer I use on my primary laptop has. I really wish they would add some functionality to the stock Chrome PDF viewer. I also had to use another Java-based program for another one of my classes (fig-tree),but it wasn't a hassle at all to work around (especially for a program I needed for only  barely even 10 weeks). At this point, even if something were to happen where my Chromebook stops working, I would definitely look into buying another one!

308,"Bought this computer in February 2013. I knew this laptop had a slow processor, very limited operating system ChromeOS but it's been useful to me.Pros: Great keyboard, battery life, HDMI out at 1080p makes it a useful TV YouTube playerCons: Terrible screen (low resolution, 1366 x 768 and just generally low quality), faster processor would be nice, SD card can't go fully in (even with the special half-sized microSD adapters designed for Macbook), Outer casing gets smudged/marks REALLY easily (I purchased a $5 or $10 neoprene case designed for tablets for it - you really need pouch/case to protect it from scuffing)I am productive on the PC with Google Docs and do all my university computer science assignments using an alternate operating system installed on top of ChromeOS.If Samsung release a new $250 chromebook with less bezel, 1080p screen and a faster ARM processor + more RAM at the end of 2014, I'll seriously consider buying it.It's probably not worth it for most people in 2014 - the ""bargain"" is fading with its ageing technology. Not worth $250 (especially if you have to pay shipping). If you're only paying $200 all up, probably still worth it.EDIT October 2014:About 7 or 8 months ago the screen started to have problems - started with flickering and moved to incredibly overwashed colors that sometimes happen. Pressing the a certain part of the laptop bottom sometimes fixes it for a short period of time. I since opened it up several times and pushed the ribbon cable in, but it doesn't solve the problem. It's gotten to the point that I am buying a new IPS screen for nearly $90! But it will hopefully be much higher quality than the original terrible one.Moral of the story: the build quality is quite terrible (still love the laptop though, but the total value of the purchase has fell. I am dropping the rating to 4 stars purely because this problem. If it never happened - it would be a full 5 star laptop.

My father utilizes the computer mainly to browse the internet, listen to music, watch youTube, chat and email. I believe this was the very perfect gift for him because his old laptop was crashing on him because it was getting old it was really heavy and it wasn't holding a charge. It is very simple to use even for a not so computer savvy person.The chromebook is very light, it is lighter than my Kindle Fire(previous Generation) is compact and just the right size. it is not too big or too small. I believe the 11.6 inch is a pretty decent size for what my dad uses the computer for. We were watching youTube videos while browsing the internet and the computer does its job very effortless. We also own a smart TV and my dad was so trilled that he can stream videos from his laptop into the TV without having to download the video into the computer and putting it in a memory stick. You can also use the HDMI connection into the TV, however the Bluetooth option is a lot better because he can play the video and browse the internet at the same time.Whenever my father wants to write a document he can use Google docs which converts a word document automatically into a Microsoft Document, also you can save the document into  your Google Drive which gives you 115 GB of memory for FREE for two years that’s a huge savings right there including the fact that you don’t have to buy programs to write a simple document. In addition it comes with antivirus so you just turn the computer on and browse it up!!! Note: that this computer does not work like a regular Microsoft computer it only downloads apps.When we first opened it, we just logged on with our current Gmail account and uploaded some of the free apps. It was fast and easy we tested the apps, and we uploaded 500 songs I owned in iTubes into Google music player from the old computer without any hassles.Over all this computer is very useful , practical, compact and it is great for somebody who just uses it for Web, video, chatting and email, I find it even better than a tablet. This devise also plays flash video perfectly and fast. I like this devise so much I plan on getting one for myself.

In the end, I ended up returning this machine for this reason AND mostly because it is soooo small and compact that it's not suited for folks of my parents' age. The screen and icons are very tiny, they could not function well with such a small display. I might have pushed them to suffer through this had it not been for the connectivity problem (I googled it, it's a recurring issue with this machine).

Also I took this on a plane with me and tried to open some games I had downloaded the apps for, etc, and nothing would open without internet connection. Yes you can download apps but you really need wi-fi to open them, unlike the ipad or other tablets. That was a little frustrating. The camera also isn't the best, but I didn't expect it to be really.

I've had many laptops and netbooks over the last couple of years; including 2 Asus EEEPC netbooks, a Toshiba Netbook, Macbook 13""(2006), Dell XPS 13"" (2007), and this has to be one of my favorite computers. I've also used a Macbook Air 13"" - my dad's and a Dell XPS 13"" (2012) - my sister's, and I was debating between the Chromebook and a Macbook Air 11"", and I'm happy I went for this.I was essentially looking for a computer to do basic web browsing, typing (a lot of documents to type and edit), watching occasional videos (streaming via Hulu, Netflix or Plex), and listen to some music, and this little computer does all of it for a super competitive price. I am using Google Docs and Outlook.com's Word support to edit/type all my documents. Netflix/Plex stream without a problem. Spotify/8Tracks work without a hitch. I really don't use anything else on a regular basis; especially when I am sitting in a cafe or when I am on the road. The offline support for Google Docs is also handy if you're stuck without internet.The main problems I had with all the netbooks were that the resolution was terrible, the monitor felt too small, the chassis bulky and cheap, and the keyboard dismal. The chromebook is how a netbook should be. The resolution is great, the keyboard phenomenal, and the computer is super light (barely heavier than a Macbook Air 11"") and feels well built even though the construction is plastic.I still keep have my Dell XPS hooked up to a monitor to do some advanced stuff - some programming, photo editing, apps that require a decent Windows computer. But I highly doubt that I'll be using that pc on a daily basis to do the basic stuff anymore.Oh another impressive factor is that this computer makes no noise, barely emits heat, and boots up super fast. And even with a whole bunch of tabs open - Spotify App, Google Docs, 5 other tabs, there was little to no lag in the system.I really can't ask much more for 250$.

318,"This laptop has exceeded my expectations. I have been looking for a second laptop for a while now and this one was a perfect fit. Being a college student, I am always lugging my laptop around with anything else I may need. My other laptop is a Dell Inspiron M1503. Weighing almost 6 lbs, which is heavy compared to the Samsung Chrome book weighing in at right around 2 lbs. As many other comments have mentioned, the keyboard is amazing. It is unlike the dell(keys are slightly more spaced out and some slight changes). It was not a problem for me to make the adjustment. About 1 days time and I can already type faster and more accurately than on my other. I am actually typing on it now and when possible I try to type all my documents on the Chrome Book. One final point, the battery life is awesome. I generally get about 6 hrs browsing the internet and streaming Pandora. It slightly decreases when streaming Netflix but thats to be expected. If I am just typing a document I can get 7+ and without wi-fi on (rare) I have had 10 hrs. The setup of the laptop is very nice and is a great second laptop. I would not recommend this for someone who needs to run demanding programs or programs that take up alot of space.

319,"I have had this Chromebook now since November 2012 and love it.  My wife has her ipad that she uses around the house for normal email, web browsing, pinterest et. I prefer to use a trackpad and keyboard to browse the internet so the chromebook is perfect for me.  The chromebook is slightly underpowered, but I haven't noticed any real problems using it for any online application.For users just looking for a device to purchase items online, watch youtube.com, pinterest, and email this is the perfect computer.  For most people (80% + of all computer users at my guess) this device is all someone needs.Now, I am really looking forward to the new chromebooks to come out.  Hopefully the Haswell powered chromebooks are a little more powerful/fast.  I'm going to keep my eyes peeled for the new Asus and Toshiba chromebooks to come out soon.

320,"If you can wrap your mind around the fact that this is not a laptop, and if you are invested in the Google ecosystem, you will love this device.  My last laptop was such a piece of crap that I mostly used it for surfing anyway.  So I was mostly looking for a cheap web browser.  Chromebook is perfect for that.  It is super fast, light, and quiet (solid state drive).  As the Play Store gets more useful apps, it becomes more useful.  I can use Chrome's remote desktop to connect to my work computer (even without the VPN!).  I stream music, movies, and books from Google Play, Hulu, and Vudu.  The OS patches itself, so you don't need to patch Adobe and Java and SPx and antivirus and all that.  Every time you boot it checks for updates and installs if necessary.  Even then, it still take less than 10 seconds to boot.  All in all, this is not much different than a tablet, but I prefer its format.  Bottom line is, this is a great device for the price.On the down side, it is fairly limited offline.  But my phone has unlimited data, so I can always connect to my phone AP when traveling without a problem.

321,"It's fine overall, good battery life, I get close to six hours running it wide open. It's not a computer and there are things that I wanted it to do and it won't. The machine will not run .exe files so it puts a lot of online games out of your reach. Other than google apps, the selection of apps is very small. Yet it does fine with basic typing and the like. It's fast to boot up and so far it has only crashed a couple of times. It runs warmer than I was led to believe. Not nearly as hot as a lap top but it does produce some heat.  It's got a very solid feel to it, the key board is excellent and as I said it fills most of my everyday needs quickly and smoothly. I think it was well worth the money. So if you are thinking about a ""computer lite"" device, I think this one will do well for you!

322,"This is a great value proposition if you understand what you are buying.  I would urge you to check out Google Chrome and Chromebooks online before you buy.  Alot of negative feedback seems to come from people who didn't fully understand what they were buying.Personally I have accepted that I will rarely use a computer offline again.  So this works well for me.  If you are into online MMORTS, etc.. you may want to spring for the Samsung Chromebook Series 5, as this model will lag a bit at times.  Otherwise it surfs the net just fine.As with Macs, the only significant drawback this has for me is the lack of a solid Personal Financial Management application (i.e. Quicken).  Cut rate knockoffs are available and will suffice for some (but didn't for me).

323,"I purchased my samsung chromebook about a year ago and decided to add a very short review after an incident yesterday.  I was walking across my living room which has a hard wood floor and was balancing the chromebook in my right hand with the screen closed. I fumbled and dropped it from about 4 feet onto the wood.  It bounced and skidded another 5 feet or so.  I have never dropped a laptop even on carpet without breaking the screen before this.  I was certain it would be toast.  I rattled it and there was no rattle.  I opened it and it was immediately up and running like nothing had happened. The plastic didn't crack and the screen is good as new.  This is a very tough little device and continues to be my go to device at home for all my computing needs.  Very well made sturdy inexpensive device which I heartily recommend.

324,"I love this Chromebook.  It feels like I am using a 'real' laptop in a tablet format.  I am in charge of technology at our school - when we went to our 1:1 program I did a significant amount of research and could not find anything that convinced me the iPad or tablet was the way we should go - so we went with laptops.  I seriously am considering going to the Chromebook for the next school year.  It is lightweight, comes on immediately upon opening the lid and very easy to use.With that said - I have had one minor problem.  Took it to my son's over the holiday and had some website loading problems.  Google related pages came in just fine - some out of the network sites were very slow coming in and some would not load at all.  I'm 98% sure it was a firewall on his server - as soon as I got home everything loaded very fast with no problems.

325,"The Samsung Chromebook is an excellent budget laptop....that is, if you are immersed in the Google culture. The laptop features a keyboard that measures very close to a full size one. In fact, the keyboard width is only a fraction of an inch narrower than the keyboard on my 14-inch laptop. The ARM processor is fast, battery life lives up to the advertised six hours (for most uses), and size and weight are great for maximum portability. It's got a great screen on it, the wireless card works very well, and the sound is at least as good as that on a good tablet. Of course, this isn't a full powered, full featured laptop, so if you're looking for that, look elsewhere. But, if you're a Google fan, have the need to create documents on the road, but still prefer a small, light device, you can't beat this.

327,"Have had my chromebook for a couple of weeks now and overall really like it.Pros:-sleek look and functionality, light, gorgeous.-takes literally less than 5 seconds to boot up and shut down.-long battery life (though it drain much faster when you are streaming).-I love how easy it was to set up and get everything going. You just enter your google account and it uploads everything- including bookmarks and saved passwords...it was a little creepy even.-decent sound. I came from a media computer with INCREDIBLE sound, so it was hard to adjust to, but I'm used to it now, and can't complain, it's comparable to my husband's in sound.-price is WONDERFUL. such a bargain. it's sturdy enough for a laptop, portable and light enough to compare with a tablet in portability.-love that it has an HDMI port, it's so nice to be able to hook it up to the tv for better viewing with groups.Cons:-I'm a huge multitasker online, often opening tons of tabs while watching a video. It definitely doesn't like that.-I miss my normal games. solitaire, freecell, where are you? :(-I HATE the apps. I thought it would function more like a tablet in that aspect- that things like pinterest or reddit would open as their own application. nope, they almost all just open in the browser. I don't need a downloaded application to take me to a commonly visited website! so pointless.-why the HECK are the speakers on the BOTTOM of the computer?-I wish there was better...I don't know, categorization of files? I like that windows has ""music"", ""documents"" and ""pictures"" preset, this has no such thing and I had to create it and just save files accordingly. something silly but it bothers me nonetheless.-no disc drive, so no cd/dvd burning, but this was no surprise, I knew what I was getting into.Even though my complaints seem numerous, they're really minor. The only REAL complaint is the lag with lots of things open, but I'm pretty impressed with its functionality for the price. If you're looking for something simple and portable with many benefits of a larger laptop, and you're a google fan, I don't think you'll be disappointed. But don't expect to get a laptop with all the bells and whistles something larger, with more space and whatever else computers have in them.

328,"This is not a laptop.  It is not a netbook.It is a very useful machine, provided you aren't expecting the above.  For web browsing, it's great.  Boots in seconds, wakes from sleep in seconds, supports Flash sites, Netflix streaming, has a webcam for Google Hangout.  If you're heavily invested in Google products (Drive, Gmail, etc), you are going to love it.I find I use it most when I have tasks that require more typing than I want to do on a smartphone or tablet.  It's light and has a comfortable keyboard.  USB port supports a mouse, keyboard or mass storage device.  HDMI port will extend the desktop on to a second monitor.So, go into this purchase understanding the limitations, and realize that you really are getting a great device for such a low cost.

329,"I teach computing/Internet to seniors and this is the perfect computer for them. They do not have to worry about updates or malware/virus protection. I have found they can pick up most of what they need to know in 2 weeks time without any prior computer knowledge. I have my own Chromebook and with their permission I can sign in to their accounts on mine and assist them remotely. That is very handy because we are only in the same location in the winter in South Texas. Most seniors want Facebook, email, Google search and Kindle for PC. Once they have that down pat they are happy. Chromebook is the perfect tool for them and me.Another point I want to make is that the apps include most anything you would want to do on any computer. I have yet to find anything I cannot do.

The only difference between this Unit vs Mac ""OS"" and Windows ""OS"" is that you don't have a desktop folder to use (drag and drop), but the file system is the same in terms of organization. I added one of those memory cards that sit flush almost inside the unit for 128gigs plus another 100gigs (free cloud space) from Google, is more than Adequate. I went from Photoshop to Pixlr Edit so no problems with photos... For a $250 price tag you truly cannot go wrong...

332,"Just like you, I've been watching this product segment develop over the past 18 or so months. The premise (or promise, depending on how you look at it) is simple: a no-hassle laptop for little cash that is safe, easy-to-use and capable of delivering ""the goods"" when it comes to input (re: keyboard). The Samsung Chromebook succeeds on most fronts.I won't bore you with a review of each little nook and cranny of the hardware or software, as most other reviewers have done a good job at such. You won't get anything more out of my take on them.So..Regardless of if you are a heavy user of Google services, this little wonder is still a good choice for daily ""computing"". You can zip around on the net and do things most people do on the web without much hassle. Where things get good is the integration of Google Drive; your work in ""the cloud"" is such a convenience that its astounding it took so long for this concept to be adopted as a main feature of a computer. However, constant internet access is still what makes the laptop a success ultimately.Can you use this thing offline? Kindof, but don't worry about that too much. The whole reason you're probably on the computer to begin with is to access the internet...the situations where you need to be doing something sans internet access are reasons not to buy this laptop; serious gaming, photo/video editing, media creation. If you're in the boat where you need (I repeat NEED) to do some hard gaming or media creation, then this isn't your main laptop anyways. There are extensions and apps that help with that, but don't cut the mustard for power users of Photoshop, Pro Tools, etc etc.So, why did I buy this? 1) I love Google's suite of services; they are productive and let me do ""stuff"" quickly and easily-- emails, docs, spreadsheets, sharing photos, social networking, etc. 2) Its $249. That's the main event here. If it gets dropped or stolen or smushed, I'm not losing any sleep. 3) I have a tablet, smartphone and main computer-- this thing fits in the space where a smartphone is too small to do serious ""input"" (typing) and a tablet isn't quick enough. Face it-- sometimes its just easier to do stuff with a keyboard. You cannot value a hardware keyboard enough. If you're considering making the Chromebook jump, any trepidation will be absolved within moments of your first post, email or search on the keyboard. The form factor and hardware make some tasks much easier-- especially over tablets with Bluetooth keyboards (don't get me started on how disconnected they feel).Should you buy this? Its a safe buy even for the non-Google-using set, providing you can admit that most of your computer use is online.If you can say with confidence ""I mostly use my computer to pay bills, email, window shop and stay connected with society via social networking, streaming audio/video"" then you don't need to look much further...this is a great solution. And don't worry about operating system loyalty-- the web is the web is the web.WHAT'S GREAT+ Price+ Wi-Fi is outstanding and reliable (this also depends on your Wi-Fi router's prowess)+ Intergration of Google services, ESPECIALLY Google Drive+ Lightweight+ Compact+ Chrome OS is very very stable and constantly updated+ Superior start-up/shut-down time+ Cloud computing concept actualized+ HDMI Out+ SD card slot+ USB ports+ Supports Netflix!+ Battery life is outstanding+ 100 GB of Google Drive storage for 2 years (!!!)WHAT'S DECENT+ Keyboard+ Trackpad+ Screen+ Chrome apps & extensions+ Speed (its powered by smartphone guts-- considering that, its pretty speedy)+ Headphone outputWHAT NEEDS HELP+ The speakers are downfiring...there is some real-estate on the screen bezel that could have accommodated them+ The screen viewing angles aren't great, but for personal use its fine+ The pitch of the screen hinges could improve; I would love to tip the screen back another half-inch or so+ Charging connector is a thin, long pin on a right-angle..it won't be a problem for me, but less careful users will break it or bend it accidentally+ Viewing large, rich photos from the SD slot is time-consumingWHAT SUCKS+ Nothing on this is modular or serviceable...understandable given the price, however.That said, in order to hit $249, you have to give up some things, so none of the negatives above are a deal breaker.Conclusion:1) I would buy this again if stolen or damaged2) I would recommend it to my mother in-law3) Good value at $249, even $299About me:I'm the family nerd-- if anyone has tech questions they come to me. I own/have owned many computers of all shapes, sizes and OS's. I own both Apple and PC hardware. I am up on the latest tech every day. I will not recommend something based on my own excitement or use hence my ""mother in-law"" comment. Just because I like it doesn't mean others will.

333,"I am a desktop, notebook, netbook, tablet, and smartphone user.  My tablet's accelerometer and gyroscope were getting frustratingly slow, my netbook was always slow, and I wanted something with a larger screen and attached keyboard; even though I have a Bluetooth keyboard for my tablet.  Since I am a proficient typist, I tried out the Samsung and the other company's $199 version and was very impressed with the Samsung's keyboard and over-all performance of the computer.  So here are my PROS and CONS:PROS- Fast bootup time and extremely fast from Sleep Mode.  When booting up or coming out of sleep, you will need to wait a few seconds to be connected with your WiFi -- then it's full-speed ahead.- The first time Set Up procedure took under five minutes to sync all my Chrome Browser, from my desktop, bookmarks, extensions, themes, etc. and Gmail contacts, messages, etc.  What a joy to be able to get down to using this new computer instantly.- Trackpad is a joy to use.  I did slow its speed down somewhat to make it less ""active.""  The two finger movements need a little practice, but once you get use to it the functions are easy to maneuver.- My wireless mouse works perfectly with the Chromebook but I only used it once so far.  The trackpad is so easy to use that I have begun to prefer it -- possibly since I have been using my tablet for 1 1/2 years and there may be this touch transference.- I switched the Search Key to make it a CAPS lock key.  Glad there is this option.- Since I don't plan on doing any word processing, spreadsheets, photo editing, slideshows, etc. on the computer; my searching the internet, doing e-mails, streaming music and television episodes are flawless.- I find the viewing angle more than acceptable.  Sure it does ""wash out"" if you look too far up or down; but the screen's hinge is rugged and stays in place at the most desireable viewing angle.- Even though it is made of plastic and does have a very slight bend if you want to bend it, the computer is rugged and light-weight.  Going from an 8.9"" screen tablet to this 11.6"" computer does put a slight weight to the holding factor, but the computer is very well balance.- I am getting at least the advertised 6.5 hours of battery life.- There is no ""Save"" or ""Save As"" function when doing word processing (or at least I haven't found it); but everything is automatically saved in the Cloud on Google Drive.  That saves a few keystrokes.- Using CTRL-ALT-? is a great idea to see all the functions available with the keyboard when using key combinations.- The volume is more than adequate.  The speakers put out about three times more volume than my tablet.  Sure they are not part of a 2.1 stereo configuration, but they work well.  Using quality earbuds or over-the-ear earphones improves sound quality.CONS- Why is there a Search Key and a Search icon?  This is why I changed the key to a CAPS lock.  A minor annoyance.- Keyboard keys are not backlit.  I suppose that is to keep the cost and weight to a minimum.- No replaceable battery.  For $249 when the battery is depleated -- buy another Chromebook.- One final, minor annoyance:  Opening the Samsung Chromebook is a tight process.  There is a very small opening between the screen lid and the trackpad to ""wedge"" your fingers in to open the computer.  I can see this as a major problem with anyone having larger fingers than mine.  Don't put a flat-head screw driver in the slot and twist -- ha!After four days of having the Chromebook powered up for about 10 hours a day, using it a good four hours and the rest of the time it is in Sleep Mode; I can honestly say that this has been a great purchase and I would buy this device again.  I have only needed to charge it every-other-night.

334,"---------------------------------------------------------------(Update: 7/31/2013)(FYI, I am coming from installing and using Ubuntu on this device.)1) I bought 2 more for my wife and mom (ChromeOS).  They both love it. My wife doesn't carry her heavy Dell laptop any more; it stays in her office. This had also replaced her iPad (iPad 3 I think) as the new bed-side multi-media device.2) After several tries, I finally got to install CERN's ROOT successfully. (Version 5.34.00. Higher versions won't work though)  It runs really well. This was awesome, because I no longer had to SSH to my linux desktop machine for accessing ROOT.3) I use Dropbox for my cloud storage.4) I compile codes, creates graphes, read pdfs, make power-point (Libre Office) files, do emails, access other servers globally, and etc.(Seriously, if you are a ubuntu person, you don't need too much storage.)5) The typing feels slightly choppy. I think this has to do with the ARM-core optimization; after a few days though, I got used to it and it doesn't bother me any longer.So after more than 7 months of using it, I still love it.---------------------------------------------------------------(Update: 2-12-2013)I hope everyone knows that I am not a complete idiot in saying this is a Quad-core.I know it is supposed to be a Dual-core. However, when I view the system detail on Ubuntu, it says ?????x4, which means ""Quadcore.""  So I'm not sure which one is right.But I decided to stick with what my notebook tells me.Also, it turned out what I installed was Chrubuntu, made specific for chromebooks.Everything works very well, except for speaker which has an easy fix.  (Please, read also the comments.)---------------------------------------------------------------It seems this whole thing is very misleading, because this notebook should come as something quite revolutionary, but Samsung does it very quietly, and humbly, by releasing this system with a very cheap pricetag and without any advertisement.  Not to stir the water I guess? :)Anyway, as a satisfied Samsung Series 9(made of duraluminium and expensive with SSD) user, I wrote a review saying ""I wished Samsung would make ARM-based notebook"" in the past, because even with SSD it came short of being ""ideal"" package due to it having to cool mechanically the Intel-based chip, which still made fan-noises. Well, 1.5 years later, this is my dream come true; and a quad-core chip at that!! :) This is a revolutionary stuff in computing.I'm involved in particle physics research, in which vast majority scientists use linux-based systems. So, as soon as I received this chromebook, I brought ""Ubuntu Reformation"" on it. (No ""95-thesis"" though.) It does everything I need for my research.  It's blazingly fast. A wonderful system for a research guy like me.  (There are many wonderful video instructions available on youtube for installing ubuntu.)There, however, is one thing that didn't work, which most customers could just simply ignore and is not the system's fault.  There is a math analysis tool called ""ROOT"" developed by CERN scientists, and used widely by many particle physicists out there. Well, I wanted to build the ROOT from source code, and it gives me options for ""linuxarm"" architecture.  It compiled successfully, but it just won't run, and freeze at the startup.I wish someone from Samsung community and from CERN community could sit together and resolve the compatibility issues.  This system would do wonders for the CERN scientists, I'm sure.PROS1. No moving mechanical parts, such as hard-drives or cooling fans, which means it is absolutely quiet.(If you are a student, this could be a huge plus in a classroom, because your notebook doesn't make noises like your classmate's, which means your professsors are less annoyed by notebook noises, which could means he/she could give you better grades.:))2. Screen:  Although it seems somewhat ""washed-out,"" I actually like it, because it hardly gives strain on my eyes. It's actually more like glittery washed-out, if you will. (Maybe that's why the system was intentionally designed that way?)  For guys like me who have to look it computer monitors all the time, this is very important. How should I say it..., it gives me a clean feeling to look at the screen.3. Quad-Core Exynos chip:  It's a wonder!  It makes me think that maybe all the microprocessors are supposed to be made this way from the getgo... maybe its the other articheture brands unable to produce their chips less dissipative, having to require customers to attach huge cooling fans, thereby neccesitating another industry (cooling fans) unneccesarily; only that it asks the customers to pay for their failure.  Too much conspiracy theory?  O well, if you know anything about solid-state physics, you know it is a major challenge to create a microchip less dissipative of heat. Anyway, one thing for sure, I guess Samsung engineers had figured out how.  And it is amazing.4. Very affordable. Light and slim.5. No headache due to fan-noises.  I might be overly sensitive, but I get headaches from computer fan-noises. Whenever I turn off my other ntebook computers, I instantly feels stability in my soul. It's that bad.  So this noebook is also medically - and psychologically - commendable.5. Solide performance: It feels solid and fast.6. The temperature gets ony to ""warm""-level at times when I watch youtube; otherwise, no heat coming from this notebook.CONS1. This is coming from using UBUNTU.  You must ""unmute"" speaker every time you reboot.  (To do so, you open the terminal and type ""alsamixer"" and unmute by pressing ""m"" at the speaker bar.)  But this is no problem for me, because I only reboot once in a full moon.2. I tried to access this system(UBUNTU, not ChromeOS) through SSH command from my desktop computer, Well, not that it's slow, but it seems a little jerky, not smooth. But if it is the other way around, meaning you access other machine using from this notebook through SSH, then it is no problem. (Maybe still some more compatibility issue to work out?)3. For ChromeOS, skype doesn't work.  But I've read somewhere that they are working on it.4. I wished there was a microSD slot, instead of a regular SD card slot.  Also the SD card sticks out.  Maybe they could have made the bay a little deeper.CONCLUSION: I only write reviews for which I can give 5 stars.  So here it is.  This chromebook by Samsung is a wonder. Do not be deceived by how Samsung released it with such a cheap pricetag, a ""stealth technology"" sort in marketing strategy I guess, because this is nothing short of a revolution IMHO.

337,"I was looking for something that I could bring to school (not LUG to school) to take notes on and easily access the internet for research. The chromebook has allowed me to do that and much more. Working strictly from the cloud takes some getting used to and so does crossing over from whatever typical word processors or spreadsheets you are used to using, but once you do the benefit of being able to access those docs and spreadsheets (or presentations, etc.) from anywhere outweighs the learning curve. I thought that not having a large hard drive would bug me but since I use my desktop for all downloads it really hasn't hindered anything I've tried to do. I would insert a caveat here and that being, if you don't have another computer (laptop with a large hard drive or desktop), I wouldn't choose this computer simply because there are some things that chrome os (although I love it) cannot do and you don't have storage space for large downloads.The price point is also a huge plus for many of us students who don't the discretionary income to drop on a macbook. I highly recommend this product. Google is a leader in innovation and Samsung makes quality products. This is one of those innovative, quality products which I have found extremely useful.

Boots fast but we just leave it on because when closed it uses almost no battery and comes back to where your were when you last closed it.  The responsiveness of the chrome browser is amazing and the unit will open microsoft documents attached to emails without any problems.  You can connect the gmail in here to other email accounts and view everything from the one app.  You gotta try this device if your looking for a great web appliance.

339,"I use this everyday! What used to be my main laptop - a 17"" HP with a battery that only lasts 2 hours is almost retired. I only use it for the iTunes on it. If you're looking for an everyday simple laptop then this is for you! I thought that 11.6"" was going to be too small but it really isn't. It's perfect for me - for someone who just surfs the web, shop, email, watch movies/videos. I love the 8+ battery life.I've owned this for about 5 months now and it's beginning to crash - maybe once every 2-3 weeks; the screen will freeze then restart but you get what you pay for and if this happens to be inoperable sometime in the near future, I wouldn't care, I would buy another one in a heartbeat.

340,"This is a great internet book with plenty of capability. As I would expect on an inexpensive device like this, the video playback has some non-smoothness (probably limited graphics processor), but is not horrible.It's so quick and simple to use. 1) open. 2) (blink) oh, it's already on. 3) use.I love the price. I like the connectivity. I struggled a little with one of the people that used it in explaining that you can't install typical applications. Everything has to be a Chrome plug-in or a web application.On the geeky side, it even has a limited Chrome Shell (crosh) for ping, tracepath, and a few other console commands. I haven't learned yet how to discover IP address (LAN IP before firewall).

341,"I really like my Samsung Chromebook. It is great for surfing the web or taking notes, etc.Some of the main problems in daily use I have found:1. The absence of the caps lock key (I can't even write caps in caps because there is no caps lock key). It is possible that this caps lock key, which has been a mainstay of all keyboards is just re-assigned somewhere else, but it is a huge problem for people that type often and count on their typing and muscle memory, etc and depend on the caps lock key being there by my left pinky. Since it is not there, when I press that key it opens up a ""search"" or ""windows"" key. It's stupid and I hate it. Getting this back to a caps lock key is essential if google wants people to migrate from being pc or windows or macbook consumers to being chromebook consumers. Because I switch from my chromebook at home to my pc at work etc, I can't really have to remember different keyboards at each keyboard station. That's ridiculous.2. I wish it could do more pc stuff. But it's not a pc, and I really should expect it to run dragon naturally speaking or microsoft word, etc. Fro the most part, internet based stuff is great!

Google is awesome and the chrome is very light weight, nicely configured and it can be all that you want it to be.  I'm learning more and more every day.  I'm not into new technology, and only want what I need, but I'm finding exploring the chrome is actually simple and relevant to my needs both professionally and for my personal use.  I love the google+.  So is the cloud ofor storage.  So if you want a nice, reliable, lightweight, small chromebook, this is the one to buy.  My laptop is not longer of us to me.

I mostly just use it for the internet, and to play music, but it is so light and easy to use.  I have dropped it a few times, one time it fell down a whole flight of wood stairs and even after all that, it still worked perfect!! Nothing can break this thing.  No virus, no issues.  Well worth it.  I tried hooking it up to a printer and had some trouble printing.  I know it is possible, I just havent figured out how yet, bought the chromebook for dummies book as well to find out how to do this and work the programs.  I do like, that even though there is not adobe acrobat, I am still able to open pdf files and view them (chromebook must convert them somehow).  great purchase.

344,"Occasionally, there are some issues with incompatible software. Things convert to Word in an odd way, for example, and using Netflix is like being in an on-again, off-again relationship. However, overall, it performs really well and I can always count on the free software upgrades to help fix issues. It's lightning fast on startup/login and does things you want it to that you can't always expect from other laptops (like saving tabs and restarting them for you). If you like Chrome, you'll love this. You'll be surprised how many functionable apps are out there to augment your experience. We haven't quite figured out how to stream to the television without serious buffer challenges, but I'm sure that between us and Google, we'll figure it out soon.

345,"Okay, so let me start by saying that I own this Chromebook now and also a very powerful Windows gaming laptop.That said, the Chromebook is my favorite of the two. This Chromebook is fantastic in every way, shape and form. The only thing that I have not been able to do with it is log in to an enterprise Microsoft Sharepoint server, but that is not a huge deal to me. I have been able to do almost anything else I would ever want to do with it. I use it every night to use Google Video Chat with my girlfriend, and the only issues I see with that are typically when the internet is slow. Nothing client-based.Logmein and Chrome Remote Desktop make for fantastic remote desktop solutions, and both work very well on the Chromebook. That is great for me because a 17.6"" gaming laptop is heavy to carry around, so if I must use Windows then I can always remote in to it from anywhere. It also helps to know that (finally) Logmein is working on an extension for Google Chrome, in case that is an important service for you.I have not had any issues with pages loading on the Chromebook. They all seem to work as they are supposed to. Even though it runs on a mobile processor, I do not notice any lag or anything like that even with 1080p video playback. Boot time is consistently under 10 seconds and time to resume from sleep is virtually instantaneous.If you are an avid user of Google services, then the Chromebook will work great for you. I use Google Drive quite frequently and the free 100gb comes in handy for me. It is great to use Google Docs when I am on the run because I can resume my work anywhere from any computer. The only issue I have with that is when typing its equivalent of a Word Document, you cannot merge cells in a table. Oh well.Battery life is great too, with an average of 6 hours on general web browsing, 4.5 for video chat.If there is anything you need to do on a Windows computer, more than likely there is a free web-based solution. For that matter, I even found a web-based alternative to Photoshop!Unlike many operating systems, updates are not something you have to think about anymore. They handle themselves, and all you have to do is restart your Chromebook occasionally (which when updating still takes under a minute).Overall I have to say, this is probably one of the best computers to be invented. Ever.

346,"Pros: Very light and portable.  Nice keyboard and plays streaming video smoothly, even in HD.  Attractive design, and super fast 7-sec bootup.  Instant on from sleeping.  Great battery life.  Easy to use, great 2 finger scrolling and finger-tap mouse clicks.  Nice assortment of ports: SD, USB 2,3, HDMI.  Plug n play mouse works without any problems.  Heavy-duty flash games run no problem.  Google docs, which can be used offline as well if you choose not to use the cloud.Cons: Sometimes text is too small initially on a webpage and have to enlarge the magnification.  Can get a bit slow if lots of flash heavy things or lots of text on a page.  (Things I think they are working on: 1)some sites like yahoo news articles will redirect you to the mobile webpage instead of the regular. 2)netflix doesn't work)Overall, highly recommend as a second computer, for casual browsers, travelers, etc.

347,"I had been looking for a lightweight laptop with a large battery life.  I was very tempted to buy the newer retina display Macbook; however, the price tag was a big enough deterrent.  I purchased the Samsung Chromebook instead, hoping it would be decent enough for the $250 price tag.I have been using this for several months now and I am surprised how often I use it.  What's more surprising is my wife actually uses it regularly.  She even claimed it as her own now.  The simplicity of having a small, long lasting, simple to use computer made it a family favorite device.  We both each own a tablet and desktop, but since purchasing the Chromebook all these devices have seen much less usage.  Having a real keyboard makes use favorable over a tablet.I expected several issues since this is a new ARM device with a new operating system, but the few I found were quickly fixed.  this is durable as well.  I have dropped it from my coffee table and bed several times without an issue.Initially I was planning to replace Chrome OS with a different ARM linux distribution; however, this has met almost all my needs.  The only thing I can't do is easily program on the device.  I have to ssh to another computer to develop code.  I have used Cloud development sites, but prefer ssh.Pros:Battery last several hours (5-7)Light weightQuickly powers on and usage on the web within 10 secondsSupports multiple users (Google Accounts)Very little to no heat coming off of the laptopEasy to updateCons:Can't do all things a standard laptop can (can not program)Native client NaCl is currently not working for ARM Chrome OS (supposedly it is in the works)Overall this device far exceeded expectation for the limited price.

It works great, it's super fast and best of all, most of the important apps are free. If you need something simple for doing schoolwork, palying games, or surfing the net, THIS IS THE WAY TO GO! However, it's not a regular computer so don't expect to install games, photoshop, be a power user, or write any code/program because you can't do that on it. You can always install Linux on it and use it as a regular laptop however. Great buy none the less.

I just use Chrome Remote Desktop, connect to my Mac desktop or PC desktop to access whatever application I need. I like that I can use it offline to take notes using Google Docs. I really like the free airline Gogo Internet passes, and the 100 GB for three years Google Drive storage. I did not give it 5 stars because the cursor disappears frequently after booting up. It is difficult to bring the cursor back. This is not a hardware glitch but a software glitch that Google needs to fix. This is well documented on Chromebook forums. A quick way to get the cursor back is to plug a mouse in a USB port of the device. Restarting it and shutting it down by holding the start button between 8 and 30 seconds, sometimes resurrects the cursor. The Chromebook boots fast, it works well with Google Hangouts video chats.

353,"If you are looking for a traditional laptop this isn't for you.  I wanted a second computer that could be used for web surfing and email primarily.  This product delivers that.  I like Chrome so being forced to use it is no big deal.  The free subscription to Google Drive is very nice.  I believe this is the future, so saving my files(mainly pictures and music) to the cloud is a great back up option.  Definitely mitigates the lack of a hard drive on the Chromebook.The keyboard is great but the track pad takes a little getting used to.  I bought a wireless mouse that should give me the flexibility if I don't want to use the track pad.  The screen isn't super but passable.  It's a $250 machine, right?I had zero issues connecting to my WiFi at home.  Worked perfectly the first time.  I bought an adapter to connect to a wired network through the USB 2.0 input if necessary.  It was $20.I can see if you use lots of Office products this might not be your device.  That's why it's a nice secondary computer for me.Another thing you may want to know is this device doesn't run Java related programs.  Kind of a drag.  Hopefully this is an update in the future.Bottom line, for the price this product does exactly what you expect.  I love it when people compare it to a Macbook Air and then complain.

It is very lightweight and compact, and extremely portable. Another thing that I am most impressed about is that it never gets hot. I am used to other laptops that get extremely hot when in use on your lap. This is not the case with this Chromebook. I do have to say that this computer will not be for everyone. It is important to know your needs before purchasing. Since programs can't be installed, just make sure that what you need can be downloaded as a chrome app, or can run from a webpage. I haven't encountered anything that I can't do. I really like that all files, pictures, music, etc are stored on the Google Drive and can be accessed from anywhere.

357,"Bought this item used (didn't realize till we received it but that's mostly my fault). What was the real problem is that this chromebook was used for a school before being sold to us and was still setup with a management account. This meant that had parental locks that couldn't be bypassed and that the original ""manager"" of the device has access to any security information or usage of the chromebook. We had to take the whole thing apart and remove the internal battery so it ""forgot"" it's manager and than reinstall chrome OS from a thumb drive.....probably something that should be dealt with before selling the chromebook.

360,"This laptop is $249 and it does what it advertises. That is, one can browse the internet and use Chrome browser apps which are pretty limiting.Being that it has an ARM processor, I wish there was a way to install Android on it and run it off of the same Linux kernel so one can switch back and forth between the two without having to restart. One can install a version of Ubuntu with XFCE so I would think installing Android would be pretty easy, yet no one has been able to do it I guess. In addition to the full desktop browsing and Google services offered by Chrome OS, Android would provide access to so many apps that are not available on Windows nor Chrome OS. Those apps would be natively supported on this processor. That would make this laptop super useful and I would pay another $150 for it even without touch support.Installing Ubuntu for ARM helps, but one's still limited by what has been complied to run on this kind of processor.Not being able to put Android on it may not be a legitimate complaint for most people. I could just imagine not needing anything else for everyday use if that were possible.

361,"I bought the Samsung Chromebook, 11.6""' Wi-Fi from Amazon.com January 13' 2013, @ 5 months ago. I loved the computer due to its ligjt weight, instant on feature and speed.Unfortunately the display screen went out today after no problems previously. I opened the display as always and the screen had lines across.  Ater several attempts to no avail decided to research this issue. To my surprise found MANY similar complaints @ this issue, including cracks on the display that mostly occurs in the right upper corner. The worse of it is the frustration experienced by many customers with Samsung's poor Customer Service regarding these issues. Samsung considers these as damages done by customers rather than a DEFECT of the product, hence, not covered by their warranty.  A class action suit is in the making in virw of the number of customers affected. The defect is apparent witin weeks or in @ 4-5 months. Repair of the screen varies between $75 to $125 for replacement, adding to the cost of $250  for a cheap laptop. Unfortunately has happened more than once to some customers. So buyers be worry and forewarned.  Google these problems..

362,"Pros:Great for school. I'm in my fourth year of college and this laptop is great for school if you don't want to spend the money for an expensive macbook. The battery lasts about 6 - 7 hours so no need to worry if you can't find a plug in class. The computer is small and light weight which is easy to take in a backpack. I am probably impressed by this laptop so much because previously I had a 17"" laptop, which was a pain in the butt to take to school and use for notes with only 2 hours of battery.Another upside, which kinda goes with the whole school thing is the one sign in chrome account. If you want to search the web for articles, school work, checking email, watching youtube or netfix, pretty much anything that is basic, AND you want a cheap computer than this is a great device. If I write out a paper for school and need to print it on a school computer then I can just log in to gmail and access it on my google drive, which you get free space when you buy a chromebook.Easy google store. It is also nice to have every program available through the chrome store. Instead of paying a bunch of money for specific programs you can just download the app through the google play store, which I might add is always being updated and added to all the time and will be for years.EASY TO USE! I am actually really good with computers, and I have a job where I sit down with customers every day at my university and help them figure out their computer issues. With that in mind, if you are one of those people who do not understand technology, you find it confusing, this laptop would be great for you. Everything that you need to access you can put it on your bar. Want to get to netflix, pandora, a spreadsheet, or gmail? For some of these you have to download the link in the app store (which is easy), and then it's on your bar and you can one click access these sites with lovely icons that look like an app on your phone. Let's say you are someone who is not a fast learner when it comes to using technology. If you go onto the customer service site, they have videos that show step by step instructions on how to use all of the features on the chromebook. No longer will you have to ask your 8 year old child or grandchild to show you how to use technology, because now you can just look up videos.CONSThere is always pros and cons to everything and although this computer is great, I still have issues.Screen flickering. I've looked it up on the forums. I recently just got this laptop and have been experiencing flickering since I first got it. I will be trying to resolve this issue shortly, but apparently it is a common and known issue, so just keep this in mind that you might get a computer with screen flickering. I have a friend who has this same exact laptop and she has never gotten screen flickering and hers is about a year old, mine is about 2 months. Also keep in mind that this is flickering even when I am not touching the screen panel or any of the wires connected, so most likely it is a software issue. Maybe I will update this once I find a solution, no promises though :PSOUNDFor the most part the speakers are great. Especially in pandora, youtube, and sometimes netflix. BUT.....BUT when you are on websites that does not have self regulated volume controls then there is a problem. What I mean by volume controls is for example the volume control on pandora, where you can make the volume much louder. Netflix will sometimes have movies or shows that are much quieter, usually documentaries, and even when I have Netflix volume cranked up and the speakers volume cranked up I still cannot hear what is being said. I have also read online that this is a common issue. Although this just seems to be poor placement for the speakers as well as cheaper speakers since the  computer is so cheap.All in all it is a great laptop and I don't have much issues with it. For the price it is definitely worth it, especially if you are in school or need a computer to travel with you a lot that you just need for most basic functions.Oh also I should note that you can torrent... not that I would do that because it is illegal. For those of you curious there is an app call JStorrent that seems to work well..... or so I've heard. There are youtube videos that say how to use it. Just keep in mind that you can really only torrent one thing at a time and it is not going to be ridiculously fast... I mean it's not super slow or anything, a windows or mac computer (depending on how old it is) will be much faster.Hope this review helps you with your purchasing needs! If you are looking for a laptop that is a bit pricier but nicer then you might check out dells XPS notebooks. The ultrabooks seem nice, and I have worked on a couple of these laptops at my job's hardware repair shop and they seem really nice.Have a fantastic day,Kristina

363,"This was hands down the best IT purchase I have ever made.  In fact, I'd say this is my favorite possession!  I bought this product in October of 2012 as a replacement to my aging, quite heavy, and quite expensive ($2,000 at the time) business laptop.  The trade-offs in low price, excellent battery life, lightning fast startup/reboot, and portability (light weight) immediately make up for any minor annoyances (or just things that are ""different"" - which you end up getting used to quickly.)  I use this machine for business communication and occasional personal projects.  I've found an app (even some that work ""offline"") for everything I need to do (even including high tech tasks like programming, connecting to servers, transferring files, etc.)  The only time I find myself switching to a desktop machine is for graphic design tasks.  (I find the screen too small for the precision needed.)  For me, it's a plus that my documents are stored online.  If my Chromebook is ever stolen or dies my data is retained and I'm only out $250 bucks.  In either of these cases, I wouldn't hesitate to purchase another one.  I am thrilled with how much easier this laptop is to use and maintain than traditional Windows systems.  This is a game changer for individuals and small businesses.

I tried two of them and my general experience was that they were portable, but so under powered from a computer viewpoint that I got tired of dragging them to wifi hotspots. Just a quick summary of human factors - this chromebook is light - the keyboard is easy to type on - the trackpad is easy to use - and the battery runs for 5+ hours. I don't have to charge it any more than a typical cell phone.So when this device came out, it sort of broke that mold, but in a good way. I was a little afraid based on my previous experience as to this basically using a ""Smart Phone"" CPU, whether it would be slow as well, but the usage of a solid state drive (SSD) (as opposed to a platter based drive) gave me enough confidence to take the jump. I was hoping it would be sort of like ""low end MacAir"". And I think it does meet that criteria for about 20% of the equivalent apple cost.I N T E R F A C E SOne of the most important things with any computer is how well does it play with the peripherals. I was scared with a new operating system that this would be a weak point. Obviously the first and primary one is to the internet with a ""cloud based"" computer. I've connected the device to several different wireless routers and hot spots and never any trouble there. Of course a failure on this front would make this device Dead On Arrival (DOA).S T O R A G ESo I connected several storage devices that I had used on PCs and Macs (USB sticks, and SD cards, and external hard disks) - everyone of them worked with no trouble. So even though you only have a little bit of storage on the actual computer, you can have lots of extra external storage. Things to note here, there is an ""App"" called ""Files"" that will show you all the files that are stored locally or in the ""cloud"" (e.g. ""Google Drive""). If you bring some external storage to the party (e.g external disk, flash disk or SD card), you will find it here. One time I was copying music files to the local disk and accidentally sent it to the cloud disk. I then re-discovered the fact that on most internet connections the uplink is much slower than the downlink. This isn't a problem with the computer, but just something to keep in mind, if you decide you want to copy over a load of data to a cloud based drive, it may take a good long time!A P P L I C A T I O N SI've been using ""Google Docs"" (recently renamed ""Drive"") for years, so no troubles figuring this part out. I really do like being able to access certain files from any computer on to which I've logged on. There are certain things I am just more comfortable where I am more comfortable using MS office 2003, but that is with complicated multi-tab spreadsheets. Note Office 2007 and 2010, etc are just plain painful to use. Having been using MS office products for 2 decades, the change in the user interface is just down right irritating, and I will never spend any more $ on that product line due to the complete lack of respect for the user or backward compatibility. I am happy with google docs or open office which retain the user interface that MS created and discarded. I haven't even tried, but I suspect if you wanted to create a movie or do some serious photoshop work - this will not be the computer for you. Go grab your high end Mac.O F F L I N E  --  A P P L I C A T I O N S(e.g. Desktop Apps (e.g. not in a browser))This was one of the main things that sold me on this computer versus a completely cloud based computer. The ability to do some things without internet access.For Google Docs - currently only the word processor and chart maker work off line. So no spreadsheets in the Outback or on most planes. There are a few other applications that exist outside of the ""browser window"" if you miss that sort of thing. There is a ""calculator"" and ""scratch pad"". There are probably other things floating around in the google play store, but I haven't gone looking extensively. Note that this is a completely different operating system (not windows, mac or linux) so sometimes when you view a website - and they try to figure out what sort of application fits your machine - it gets sort of interesting - usually they guess its some version of linux so you end up with these ""tar"" or ""crx"" files.You can look through photos and listen to music without internet access. It's not obvious because you won't see a picture viewer or music player in the application list. But from the file application - which presents a directory like structure if you hit a picture (*jpg) or music (*mp3) file the correct program will show you the photo or play the song.Note that skype doesn't currently work on this platform - but Google Hangouts works just fine as a replacement and you can have a whole family get together (4 locations) without any additional charge.""O F  --  M I C E  --  A N D  --  M O N I T O R S  ------  M O V I E S  --  A N D  --  M U S I C""I connected several two button USB mice to the computer and it makes it a lot easier to use. I can get by with the trackpad - which works fine - but for any sort of serious computer work - I still like the mouse. I do have a hard time getting the ""right mouse"" click to be recognized on the trackpad. You are supposed to hold down two fingers for a little bit to the the ""contextual"" menu.I connected a large TV set with the HDMI connector and that worked pretty well. I was able to watch a amazon video just fine. There were a few cases where the on screen motion was very quick that the graphics couldn't keep up and got a little pixelated. So if you want to watch action movies you may have trouble. Netlfix doesn't seem to work, since it uses the MS ""flash"" equivalent. Well let me take that back I just went and opened up netflix to get the name of the missing driver and it is now working. So if you like to watch videos - I think it supports most services (netflix, vudu, youtube).You can certainly play any of the music systems on the internet here, I guess iTunes would be excluded, due to it's basic nature of being a windows/mac application, and the ongoing fight between google and apple to be digital content distributors. I have used grooveshark, the amazon MP3 player, google MP3 player and the actual resident chromebook player with no trouble. I actually sit the chromebook on top of the stereo sometimes and connect the headphone jack and it runs for hours with no troubles. If you really really feel compelled to get something ""ITunes like"", there is an android phone app called ""DoubleTwist"", but I think it needs a windows laptop to run. While I have a retro 30 GB iPod at home, for the most part I stream music from one of the services above now days. In the car I like satellite radio due to the variety and not having to worry about a data connection, which is spotty and slow out where I live.Weird random fact - I tried to connect my nexus 4 phone to the chromebook and it didn't recognize it. So two flagship google products aren't compatible.  A day later I realized - well if you believe in the ""cloud"" then you don't really need to be moving data around with USB cables! But still - sort of funny that my ""google phone"" is recognized by Macs and PCs but not the chromebook.2nd random fact - the power button is right where the ""forward delete"" key is on a windows machine. So if you are used to using that key, you will occasionally be surprised by your chromebook being powered off. On the good side I do like all the dedicated buttons above the numbers (""Full Screen"", brightness, speaker volume and mute).I haven't gone and purchased a compatible printer yet to check out that interface. But I wouldn't expect too much trouble, since printing things is one of the core competencies any computing device needs to exhibit. When I cross that bridge, if I have troubles I can update this note. Do note that most of your USB and older Wifi printers won't work. So count that in your costs if you plan on making this your one and only computer. Since new printers are usually the cost of the old printers print cartridge I'm not really worried about this. if you are in the market for a new printer, you can google ""cloud ready printers"" and probably find something that fits the bill.Bluetooth - There is a bluetooth interface, but it isn't intended for music streaming or headsets. I tried. But I can confirm it will work with a bluetooth mouse. And apparently with a bluetooth keyboard, but why you would want to use a separate keyboard escapes me, unless you had it connected to the TV and wanted to ""surf around"" from the couch. I had hoped to use my bluetooth headphones, but that isn't yet possible. There is a wired headphone jack (3.5 mm) jack though.Internet Access Note - I have been able to setup the nexus phone as a portable hot spot for the chromebook with no trouble - I have decided that I will have a ""talk phone"" and a ""data phone"". Sometimes the smart phones make it too hard to do the basic phone function. So for the data phone I signed up for the T-mo $30 4G plan with 5Gb of data and 100 minutes. While obviously this depends on how fast the wireless carriers data runs at, but I have been able to get 10 Mb downlink (e.g. fast enough) going from the Nexus 4 google phone to the chromebook. I also installed ""AdBlock"" and it is way nice to view most of the internet without all the flashing advertisements. I'm thinking that also helps with bandwidth.R E T I R I N G  --  T H E  --  N E T B O O K SIn fact my two netbooks hardly ever get used anymore, and of course when I do turn them on once a month, they spend half an hour downloading all the latest security patches from the ""mother ship"" in Seattle. Seriously how can any operating system just have continued on-going security patches issued for years on end?! Random aside the only good MS operating systems I've really seen were windows 95, 2000, XP, and 7. But again the on-going battle to keep viruses and security patches under control is something you won't ever have to think about with this device. I suspect windows 8 (an operating system that can't figure out if its a tablet or a PC) along with the new office interface will lead to the ultimate marginalizing of a once great software development firm.T H E --  B O T T O M  --  L I N EThis device is light and easy to carry around. Boots in no time at all which is really nice (having made a habit of going and getting a coffee while waiting for Macs and PCs to startup). Beyond that you don't really have to turn the thing on and off, just close the lid. It doesn't overheat and there is no fan - due to the lack of heat generated by this CPU.  Checking emails, creating documents, listening to music and watching streamed movies/TV is easy. I wish this thing had been around when I was shopping for the netbooks. It is pretty much the only laptop I throw in my backpack now-a-days!U P D A T E:On my last note - be careful when ""throwing it in your backpack"" - I almost broke off a plastic segment from the rear; however I was able to ""super glue"" it back into place. Also the bluetooth headset function now works (apparently an update a while back); I can stream from grooveshark to my stereo headphones. I have been able to do ""passthrough"" printing from the chromebook to a windows PC to my wireless printer. Will eventually get a printer with ""native"" support for the chrome-book.L A S T  U P D A T E:Really liked this computer, replaced the screen after I stepped on it one night. Ordered another one for my daughter and she has it in Australia. However all good things must end; someone broke into our house and ran off with the chromebook. :(So I thought I will get out one of my old WinTel based netbooks - how bad could it be? Well turned it on - and after 3 or 4 hours of downloading patches - just decided to order an acer chromebook. I was up and running again in about 10 minutes with all of my ""cloud based files"" available (e.g. the ones from the old chromebook - I had stored onlne and not on the actual computer). I think the old WinTel netbook is still downloading patches. Seriously how crappy and insecure can a single operating system be? Understand that the chromebook ""sand boxes"" things and isn't a ""full PC"" - but for most people who aren't doing video editing, software development or photoshop sort of things, this is probably more than sufficient.So while my chromebook ran great for 2+ years even though subjected to a lot of ""user abuse"" - it is gone; however this one's doppelganger lives on in Australia!

368,"When our netbook died a horrible death, I was on the lookout for a replacement laptop to serve as our secondary computing tool. I didn't want to pay the money for a Windows laptop or Mac, but I also didn't want to settle for a tablet.  After doing some research, I settled on the Chromebook, and have not been sorry.  I love that I have everything from my Google account right at my fingertips.  I love how it stays updated without my having to do anything more than restart.  It boots lightning fast, and let's me do anything I need to do.  It syncs with my Chrome browser on my Desktop, and with my Nexus 7, so I never need to worry about remembering what device I was on when I made a good discovery but forgot to bookmark the site.  I could not be happier!

369,"I do understand the Chromebook is not for everyone. But when I read some of the negative reviews, I am baffled. It makes me wonder if some of the posts are written by disappointed Chromebook users or Windows (and possibly even Mac) apologists who fear a legitimate competitor in the wings?I'm a college professor and screenwriter and the Chromebook suits me fine.  I haven't really come across anything it can't do - other than make Skype calls.  As for school assignments, I can compose professional looking documents in Google Docs. For my screenwriting, I was never much of a Final Draft user, but since Docs is not robust enough to do advanced stylesheets, I can also use OpenOffice or LibreOffice - both of which are excellent alternatives to MS Office and both of which are available online. The same goes for Google Spreadsheets. Zoho's office suite as well as a limited version of MS Office are also accessible.Perhaps my expectations were low, but I am impressed with what this machine has allowed me to do thus far.

370,"Roger Ebert once said you should review a movie by what it sets out to do, I'm going to review the Chromebook in a similar fashion.The Samsung Chromebook provides a laptop that will run Chrome, and little else. In that it succeeds. At no time did I wish for a traditional laptop because of bad performance. Multiple tabs, large amounts of javascript, flash, all worked with little hiccup on this device. Currently, I am doing the following on my Chromebook, with no noticeable slowdown:1. Writing this review.2. Listening to Google Music, piping it to my Bluetooth speaker3. Watching Netflix, piping it to my Chromecast.4. About a half a dozen tabs are open in the background, for various other things (Gmail, searches, general browsing)If this sounds like your computing habits, then the Chromebook might be for you.If you have other needs, this might not be for you.Some other notes:* Being an ARM processor, with a non-tablet form factor, battery life is awesome. 6 hours to a charge, and it recharges with the included charger in an hour or two.* Speakers are a little tinny.* The monitor is a TN, so the viewing angle is not as good as an IPS.In short, if you want to pay $250 for a laptop, and 90% of your computing is through a web browser, this is your laptop.

371,"I've ditched using a desktop or traditional Laptop in favor of my Chromebook.  Does every web service I would do before with other devices.  It's light, doesn't get warm to hold on lap. and the battery is FOREVER long.  I use this machine for hours each night and I'm still impressed with it even after a year of use.  The startup time is astounding, we're talking seconds.  Not minutes until full functioning use.  The price is another plus of course.  $250 is bargain bin price, with 5 star quality on build and performance.  Yes, you can use it off-line too for music, movies, some games, and even productivity things like word processing, and spreadsheets.  Try it out.  You won't be sorry.

The 550 which I use along with this one has only one advantage and that is its speed, which is not that much of an issue.  It is nice to no longer have to listen to the cooling fan coming on and off to cool the chip.  I really like the size and weight of this version.  It is very easy to pick up and take with you anywhere, (that has Wi-Fi).  If you use the chrome browser on any other device this is a must for you.  About the price of most tablets and does so much more.  Don't listen to the negative reviews here.  For most functions I turn to use this first.

I have read a few reviews, by in large very positive but they still did not prepare me for the quality product that Samsung is turning out. It can replace up to 90% of your computer needs if you use it in a non specialized way; the hardware is truly amazing, light like a feather, blazing fast when browsing if the wifi provider doesn't let you down, marvelous keyboard, beautiful resolution. It loads up in five seconds, shuts down in three, its battery lasts seven hours, have i said enough?Get it while its still $249 and do not fret about not having office or netflix, you will not be disappointed. .

374,"I prefer to type on a keyboard, to take notes and save my notes to the cloud, so that I can access those notes from any computer. That's a lot of what I do on a computer.This sumsung chromebook suits that purpose very well, especially for the $250 price. It has a good keyboard, although I prefer the keyboard on the CR-48 (google's prototype machine from a couple of years back) which has more bounce in the keys. The trackpad is much better than the CR-48. But what really makes this special is that it's lightweight and quiet (no fan).Because of the light weight, ironically, it's easier to do tablet like reading on it than a tablet. Often I find myself holding  it with one hand, my left, underneath the keyboard, while my right hand scrolls on the trackpad. Because of the weight distribution of the L shape of a screen/keyboard laptop, it's more comfortable to balance in my palm than trying to hold a flat tablet with one hand.I should mention the experience I had with a defect unit. I originally bought this on Amazon several months ago. The one thing that I didn't like about it was that the screen looked ""grainy"", not very clear. But, because I had bought the unit online and had not been able to demo it in the store, I assumed that was the way it was. The screen over time started to flicker and turn blue on the sides. I eventually returned it and bought another unit. With this second unit, the screen is not grainy; it's much better than the first one ever was. If I would have demoed it in the store I would have realized the first one was a defect and returned it right away.As far as the chrome OS is concerned, I enjoy the fast boot up times and easy maintenance of having an OS dedicated to a browser. I do however, like to use a linux shell for some of my work/research/fun. Although there a lot of online options via the browser, like Cloud 9, I like to have my own local machine to play with. I recently bought a Raspberry Pi (only $35 dollars) for this purpose.I have the Raspberry Pi in the basement, plugged in to the ethernet and always on. I use the chrome plug in ""Secure Shell"" to connect to the raspberry pi and do linux shell stuff. It's fast and seamless. It really makes the chromebook and the raspberry pi (which is slow for GUI stuff but fine for just the shell) both more valuable than they are by themselves.

I just ordered a $67 kit to replace the screen -- I am not happy with Samsung -- everything I've read says not to bother contacting them -- they are not standing behind their product.

My wife is eyeing the Chromebook to replace her iPad.The only thing I need now is a Wi-Fi enabled printer so I can print from this Chromebook.One limitation is I can't see any Amazon downloads of purchase histories (.cvs or .csv files).  However, for my purposes I can live with it.Oh, I am now an Angry Bird fan.Would recommend this to anyone who is looking for the same as I.I plugged in my USB and it comes up right away when I open the lid on the Chromebook.

377,"All features and benefits are there; also all caveats about limited offline functions. What more I ask of the maker (firmware?) is driver support for Ethernet. Some brands of chromebook *do* support USB adapters for Ethernet (usb 2 allows up to 1 gigabit/second data; usb 3 allows up to 5 gb/s). Alas the 3g model in 4/2013 does not. Also in the ""I wish"" category, I wish the blue-tooth connectivity (currently for mouse & full-size keyboards sold separately) would extend to direct transfer Chromebook to chromebook (and to other devices one identifies). Lastly, I have learned that the 3g model has a SIM card slot and that one can take this Chromebook to Europe and buy service on a SIM card there, month to month. The steps to ""enable Global SIM card"" involve manually typing a command at the CTRL+ALT+T prompt. It is too bad that Samsung and/or google don't point this out more prominently as an added feature to travelers who love this device's portability, speed and simplicity.

It is a great size, very lightweight, great cam/mic, and the full size keyboard is a real plus.  The fact that you don't need an antivirus program and you don't need to worry about running out of power (it has a six and a half hour battery life) is another big plus in my book.  I like the google chrome software and honestly have no complaints about it.  I have a tablet but it's limited since you need a keyboard to really do alot of things on the internet.  This netbook fits the bill. So if you are thinking about getting a netbook but not sure if you'll like this one........you will.....don't worry.

You can get one for chrome running on a windows machine etc., but not for the Chromebook.  If you are not connected to the internet a Chromebook is fairly worthless.  They are designed for the connection and they include 100gb of cloud storage for 2 years.  After the 2 years what you have uploaded can be accessed, but nothing can be added without renewing the subscription.  The screen was plenty bright for me and very readable.  The keyboard is awesome and the mouse pad is great as well.  My problem with the device lies in the OS itself, which may be great for someone just wanting to type a few things and search the internet, but is lacking for someone that expects this device to replace a windows or mac laptop.

When I recently resigned, it didn't take me long to realize that the family laptop was not going to perform well for job searching. It was 5 years old and had extremely poor response time. At this time, I did not want to invest in another laptop but needed something that I could search the web, retrieve emails and possibly create documents. I decided to look on amazon to see if I could find something that was affordable and would suit my basic needs.  I came across the Samsung chromebook.  I thank everyone who takes the time to write a review.  I was so skeptical about spending money and needed to make an appropriate choice. It stated number one best seller and had over 1800 reviews with an almost 5 star rating.  Anyone who rated the chromebook under 4 stars seriously didn't read what it was intended to accomplish.  Not only is it light weight and easy to carry, but it serves the exact purpose it was designed to.  I can do anything online super fast, read and respond to emails in lightning speed, and has google's software to prepare documents and spreadsheets.  I never used google chrome before, but it comes with an easy to learn ""get started"" tutorial and I have been enjoying every minute of learning and using this piece of equipment.

386,"July 12, 2013Now I've had the Chromebook for a couple of weeks, and I have a few more observations about it. I've gone ahead and given it another star, up to five stars, because, well, it has still been a joy to own.When last you read me, my MacBook Pro was in the shop because I had worn out the space bar. I lived with the Chromebook exclusively for just one weekend, while house sitting and traveling around, and it did not fail me. Not one bit. I have to admit, it was great to get the Mac back, but I am still using the Chromebook every day in addition to the Mac. They overlap in purpose some of the time, but the ability to multitask with *two* computers has been truly fun for this geeky gal. I was finally able to ""let go"" of my old HP netbook, too, and give it to another good home. The Chromebook is a VAST improvement over that machine, to the point that I would tell people to consider it over any other type of netbook on the market.With its lighter weight, the Chromebook is very much easier to haul around with me in my messenger bag. In fact, I have taken it exclusively on a couple of short road trips recently, preferring it for travel to the much heavier Mac. It takes less space for carrying and for setting up, so it's become my top ""travel"" computer.Though the specs say it does not have a fan and it stays cool, I can tell you now from experience that the center bottom of the machine, under the numbers and top row of letters, does get warm when watching movies online. However, it has never gotten uncomfortably or dangerously warm, even with hours and hours of streaming Netflix or Amazon Instant Video. Usually, when I feel I am abusing it a bit too much (e.g. I have it sitting on a pillow, tsk tsk!) I will move it to a laptop desk or to a surface that is less heat-reflective. So far, the machine hasn't tried to get back at me for this abuse.I am loving the convenience of Google Drive. Gone are the days of digging out the thumb drive to transfer files. I just save them to the Drive on either machine and voila, I have files accessible on both. Yay, The Google.In environments without wireless internet, I have tethered the Chromebook via my very old Android phone and the resident tethering capabilities under Wireless & Network Settings with no problem. When you do open the machine and there's no wireless readily available, it will tell you that apps are not available (including Chrome). I have yet to explore any of the ""offline"" apps for writing emails etc. that Google provides for the Chromebook. Maybe that'll be this week's exploration.I do wish the keyboard was backlit. I am a touch typer almost 100% of the time, but often have to look at the keyboard to enter numbers or passwords, so if I am trying to do that in a darker environment, I have to lean the screen toward the keyboard to light it up. That's a hassle I got used to on my old netbook. When I just have to see the keys to write, I simply switch back to the Mac, with its backlit keyboard.All in all if I only had to have ONE computer, I would prefer the Mac, but like I said, I am using both machines every day at this point, and use them both equally for writing, email, and web browsing. There is a marked difference in certain small things between machines, but overall, the differences are not jarring.I stand by my original last sentence in my previous version of the review. As a consumer-level user of computers, the Chromebook is still a seamless and user-friendly machine that I would recommend to anyone who is already tied to The Google and doesn't need a CD/DVD drive.*****June 29th, 2013I've only had the Chromebook for less than one day, so I am not quite ready to rate it five stars. I don't know it well enough yet. I ordered it yesterday and it was here within 24 hours with the little bit extra I paid for fast shipping (less than $10). That meant that for me, it's already a lifesaver, as I write a LOT in any given day. My MacBook Pro had to go to the shop yesterday for a broken space bar (at seven months young).First impressions: It's very light, and it's plastic, so it feels very different from my Mac. The keyboard, however, is a delight, especially compared to a netbook. The layout is big enough to type without feeling cramped, and though the keys feel stiff, they are responsive and easy to touch-type on. There is no back lighting, but as I said, I mostly touch type.One very funny thing I noticed -- all the letters are lower case. Go ahead. Look at the keyboard you're on right now. Upper case letters, right? Having typed on typewriter and computer keyboards with only upper case letters for over 30 years, I am still getting used to seeing them on my keyboard in lower case. It kinda throws me.I was able to customize the machine pretty quickly and get apps that I am used to running onto it, including some third-party apps that I use frequently. In the past, I have not used Google Docs or other Cloud services; I look forward to trying what Google has to offer with this machine and potentially synchronizing across both laptops.Not sure when I will use the twelve free logons with Gogo, as I don't fly often, but the 100GB of Cloud storage for two years seemed like it might come in handy. Thanks, The Google!I also look forward to carrying this machine around as my ""going out"" machine in the future. The Mac, while awesome, is a bit of a workout for the shoulder if I have to walk any distance, and is a bit much for general coffee shop type work. It's also going to be nice not flashing the Mac around the college town I live in.I have tried both Netflix streaming and tethering the machine via my Android phone. Both seemed to work well. I didn't tether for long, but the capability is there via the native wireless settings on my phone (rather than via the third-party Android app I use to tether the Mac). I will experiment with tethering when I am out and about next time -- and then check my bill to see if my provider noticed!I noticed that the speakers on this machine actually sound way better than the Mac, too. If you use it on your lap (which I know is a no-no) there is a potential of muffling them, as they are up front under the case.I will try to come back and update if I get anything more specific/technical to say about this machine, or if any of the things I like so far get better or get worse. I'd say all in all, if you really don't need a CD/DVD drive, and spend most of your time online and can stand to write either online or in Google Docs, this could turn your portable world around. Your shoulder will thank you, too!

It's very light, which is an advantage, and a bit of a worry for a guy who uses a MacBook Pro, which makes me think it's not as rugged as it should be. Of course, I'm not going to use it. The kid is. And so if it lasts a couple of years before she drops it and breaks it or loses it or lets the dog eat it, it'll be a better investment than an iPad or Android pad. Actually, I had a secondary motive: I figured it'd be a great way to access the I'net while traveling, etc. without exposing the Mac to travel vagaries or theft.

Very fast.Apps rather primitive compared to windows programs although mostly free or very cheap.Somewhat buggy if attempting to use external display (TV) to watch movies, etc with HDMI out.No delete key is somewhat irritating.Would advise anyone to buy as an alternative to using a desktop or laptop  for browsing the internet.  But do not expect full windows pc capability.Excellent for anyone who doesn't bother to keep windows software and Av up to date.

389,"This is built for cruising the web and it is built well. CHROMECAST IS NOW COMPATIBLE. I read a review before I bought mine (8/26/13) that said Chromecast was not yet compatible. It is great being able to cast anything within you browser to your HDTV. I did just now notice that there is no CAPS LOCK on this keyboard. Not a big deal for me but FYI.The build quality is amazing at the $250 price point. The keyboard is comfortable as is the touchpad. I bought this out of curiosity. I wanted to see what the Chrome OS was all about and I wasn't expecting the build to impress me but I was wrong. I have many devices that accomplish what the Chromebook is intended to do but find myself picking up the Chromebook instead of my Nexus 10. Maybe that will wear off as time goes on but as of right now, I really enjoy tapping away at this well built keyboard.I'm still trying to see what the Chrome OS is capable of but so far, it does what I expected. I will update this review once I have had more time to dive into this little beast. As of right now, if you want something to surf the web, do a lot of typing and have a Chromecast, it is well worth the $250. It also helps if you are already plugged into the Google ecosystem.

Plus, I hate having to worry about backing things up and our last laptop took all of our financial spreadsheets with it.  I still do spreadsheets, just on google drive and not excel.  Same with documents.  It never leaves the house so the wifi unit is fine for us.  No worry about pop ups, updating software or running slow.  Does the same thing every time, very quick and reliable.

It works well for email, Reddit, Netflix, and Twitch.tv. I even plug this into my TV in my living room to stream Twitch, and it handles full 1080 well enough (seems about 20 frames per second). If I drop down the resolution a notch, then there are no frame rate issues.Battery life is pretty good too. I tend to charge it every night just out of habit. I have seen it run Twitch streams for 6 hours straight on 3/4 brightness. When feeding into my TV, it can run the stream for much longer since the Chromebook's screen is the biggest source of power usage. I just turn Chromebook monitor off by adjusting the brightness to 0.I use a lot of Google products, so the integration between my Windows 7 desktop, Aandroid phone, and Chromebook is a huge plus.I have no regrets, and if this randomly broke on me, was stolen, or lost, I would buy another one.

392,"Four stars. Everything I have tried has gone well. It's smooth, starts quickly with no downtime. I'm only giving it 4 stars because I don't feel qualified to give it 5 as I haven't pushed the boundaries on what it can do and haven't explored too many apps.As far as being a netbook and browsing the web, it's perfect. Light, easy to carry around, thin and has a stable wifi. Has an hdmi output to hook up to additional displays if desired and nice for chromecast. Definitely something you can slide into a bag and carry around with you without too much hassle if you're constantly on the go.Charger is small and compact (not the typical giant brick you have to carry around.)You can download files onto the netbook directly but most of your space is accessed through your google drive.Everything syncs directly as you have to sign into the chromebook with your google account. Was a little iffy since I'd prefer having it's own login credentials since I don't exactly want to tell someone my gmail account info (although they have guest logins and can set up multiple login profiles so not really something to complain about.)The main downside is you can't install non chrome web apps onto the chrome OS so do your research and make sure you know what you want out of your laptop before purchasing.

I've used the 'Ninja' help twice, and they answered my emails very quickly, and provided the information needed in the response!The Chromebook is a quick, fun little machine...my mom loves being able to 'talk' to Google when searching!The only complaint I have is the missing 'delete' button...but that's only because I'm used to using a delete button.  My mom doesn't know the difference...she's learning to use the 'backspace' button.

It came with 2 years of Verizon Wireless with 100MB per month; which isn't much but will get you by for a day or two of checking your email, but remember to turn off images in the browser.They are built very well; I had dropped my other Chromebook pretty hard on the floor and there wasn't any damage except on the edge molding that I was able to pop back in.The Chromebook isn't for everyone, but if all you do is watch videos, write a book, or surf the web, you're good to go :)

The solution I used is called 'Crouton' if you're interested.Excellent for casual browsing, and adding Ubuntu lets you do ALMOST anything (do not buy this for gaming, duh).If you are a linux admin, you need this or something equivalent ASAP, as it is light, mobile, and versatile enough to be used in any setting, plus the battery life is insane. I can do my job remotely as long as I'm near wifi, and if something happens to it, it was only ~$200 (If you've had $2000 laptops lost or damaged, you probably understand).Note: I chose this model of Chromebook predominantly for the weight; other models have more processing speed, but tend to be heavier. The pricepoint was also a factor.

I recently took it on a road trip, and even if I couldn't get a wifi connection in the most rural areas, I was still able to watch videos on a flash drive for entertainment, or use my phone as a wifi hotspot if I really needed to.If I go into this anymore I think I will just be repeating what everyone else has already said, but overall, I am very happy with this purchase.

This thing is so simple to use and runs so smooth im tempted to replace my grandparents desktops with these.Powers on as soon as you open the lid, and from startup to desktop simply requires a google account. No more ten minute set up procedures, simply log in and you have a running computer. I had it runnning and charging for over six hours and no more lap heat. To me thats the worst part of laptops. You are sitting there grinding on your work and suddenly your lap is sweating.I would reccoment this to anyone, especially someone who is tired of getting calls from grandma asking how to check her emails.No you cant play world of Warcraft or black ops on this.

I've noticed that the Chrome browser in Windows works on many pages that my Chromebook won't work on.  Fortunately, there aren't too many sites that have this problem, but site may be essential for some folks.  For example, my kids want to use it for school (and actually do use it for school) but some of the school's and educational websites require Internet Explorer.

The battery life is 6 hours, which we love because our old one was just 2 hours and that was such a hassle.  We took it on vacation and had no problems setting it up with the motels wifi.  The main reason we got it was because we had so much trouble with viruses on our Acer even though we installed Norton and Malware and took it to a technician.Time will tell if we have any issues with that, but they say we won't.  The only thing we don't like is that you can't play games on it because it has no disc drive.  Youtube and movies load so much faster.  We love it.

Needed a portable machine for the occasional travel and day trips with which I could check email and , if required, access main computer at home via Chrome Remote desktop.Works great in those aspects. The Remote Desktop experience isn't the best given the resolution between the two machines but is most certainly functional. Glad I don't need to carry the main laptop around any more.The unit feels a little small at first but that could be because I've never used anything less than 15 inches. Unibody seems well built and durable. The trackpad takes a little getting used to and isn't as responsive as I would like and a little 'quirky' with the cursor disappearing randomly. Still haven't figured out how to do the 'right click'. The keyboard is extremely comfortable.Boots up quick either from sleep or from a cold boot. Speakers are sufficient for streaming services but would recommend headphones if possible. No issue with Amazon Instant / Xfinity / Hulu.Battery life seems to be a little lower than advertised with a full charge lasting about 4.5 hours but I haven't put that through more formal testing.One of the issues I came across was with network connectivity. Having problems connecting to Android phone hotspot (other devices connect fine). Haven't been able to figure that out yet. Most networks work fine. \Being one of the Google ecosystem constituents, loved the ease of setup, account retrieval and the consistency of syncing across devices. I can search from my main laptop, pick it up from my phone and complete it from the Chrombook. Drive / calendar and other google services work right out of the box.  A lot more offline apps coming up and that's an added advantage.Overall, a great machine for what i need it for. Recommend that all prospective buyers closely evaluate what their requirements are before but if they are Google friendly, need a 'cheap' machine to use with primarily online applications this makes a very strong case.

I have shifted to using Google Drive to store all my docs and to back up my pics. I have the apps on my iPhone and Samsung tablet as well, so everything is backed up and I can access them from any device. I never thought I would store my personal files in someone else's hard drive, but the Drive system is so easy. I love that I can edit my documents from my Chromebook, and print them off at university, without worrying about saving or emailing the correct version of a file. And if I want to show a document to someone or edit it on my phone, I can. I have even shared final papers with professors by going into Google Drive on my phone and sharing.The great thing about the Chromebook is that it functions and is cheap. I don't worry so much about losing it because my files are not stored on it, they are stored and backed up online, and it is inexpensive enough (as far as laptops go) that if I did lose it or wear it out (hasn't happened yet) it is very replaceable. It is also fairly light, and doesn't seem to weigh too much in my bag. And it would probably fit in most larger purses as well, though I tend to use a backpack most of the time.Some people have thought it weird that my computer doesn't have a CD/DVD drive. I guess this is a downfall for some, but I don't really need that function. It also won't do iTunes, so if you are looking for a computer to handle your music, this isn't it.

Today I found him walking out of the bathroom with it!I have had the opportunity to use it exactly 1 time, because he doesn't seem to leave it out of his sight. It is very lightweight, and the internet works great! I enjoyed the functionality of the trackpad, the ability to double tap lightly as well as click it like a mouse is a great plus to me. I am heavily considering buying another one, but the only thing that is stopping me is that I already have so many electronic devices including a laptop and a kindle fire so I'm not sure what I would really use it for other than having something else to play with.

425,"I have been so impressed with using Chrome on my table and Note 2 phone that I thought I would give the Chromebook a try as a replacement for my laptop. There didn't seem to be anything I was doing on the PC that I couldn't do on a Chromebook. Boy, was I right. The  chromebook is fast unlike a PC. I also link all my files, pics etc. through Chrome among the book, my tablet and my Note 2 phone. I bought a HP E-printer and I can cloud print from my tablet, phone or chromebook. My wife uses google docs like Word to do her reports.Since I bought the Chromebook I have not used my laptop.

426,"This doesn't replace a laptop for me, nor did I expect it to for the price. Rather, as other reviewers have described, it is more akin to a tablet on steroids. There were a handful of flash functions that my iPad and mobile browsers could not accomplish, and this product has fit the role nicely. It looks like a smaller version of my MacBook Pro, but of course it only accomplishes the browser functions with the same efficiency. I haven't needed to test storage yet, but I'll update once undertaken. Same for office applications and other apps. If you need a very lightweight and portable browser and keyboard for email and word processing this should do nicely.

427,"Works great for surfing the web and paying bills just don't expect to really do anything else. I got this as a cheap laptop alternative. I didn't need anything powerful and wanted something I wouldn't be to mad if I broke it while traveling. This thing is really durable too which I didn't expect. It has taken some really nasty drops/spills and still works fine. Writing this review from it right now! I also recommend a mouse to go with this computer...I don't like any touch/scroll pads.

428,"After just a couple of months of use, the Chromebook just stopped working - it was completely dead.  Not able to turn on...nothing.  We returned it and received a replacement.  A few months after receiving the replacement, the screen went out.  Luckily it was under warranty - so it was fixed in a timely manner.  Though we love the Chromebook when it works, we are afraid it will not last very long based on the track-record we've had over the past year on this item.  We will hope for the best!

429,"This computer is perfect for what I need it for.  I knew buying the Chromebook, it was not going to replace my main computer but to replace my IPad 1 for school.  My IPad kept crashing by just doing basic web browsing so I retired my IPad, at least for school use.  I didn't want to spend the money on a new IPad because I feel that Apple doesn't keep in mind when they update software for IPads or IPhones, that it may be the fruits from poisonous tree for the older IPads or IPhones.Pros:Light weight (I barely feel like its in my backpack)Amazing value8 hour battery lifeA great lookEasy to use operating systemGoogle docs can easily convert files into word or pdfGoogle playCons:So far, I can't hook up to the College printers, however, I do most of my assignments at homeAgain if you need to type papers, do web browsing, play angry birds, check email and do research  for a paper then this computer is for you!  But, this computer will not replace my primary computer as long as I am in college, so keep in mind of what you truly need because the Chromebook is not for everyone.

430,"So I bought this laptop out of curiosity for the Chrome OS, but I was pretty sure I wouldn't find much use for it in my everyday work (I'm a developer using almost exclusively open source tools and languages).However, I soon found out that the Samsung Chromebook does allow you to go into so-called ""developer mode"", where you can install a version of Linux that runs side to side with Chrome OS, kind of like a virtualization system. The piece of code that allows you to do this is called ""Crouton"", and is freely available from a GitHub repository with a very simple set of installation instructions included. It is developed mainly by a guy from Google, and it's been getting quite a bit of traction lately.After installing a version of Ubuntu using Crouton, along with the XFCE desktop, I was very surprised at the overall responsiveness of the system, as well as at how easy it is to switch from Ubuntu to Crome OS with a simple keyboard shortcut.Granted, there are some things that still need some more work (e.g. playing videos and flash support out of the box), but given how easy it is to switch from one OS to the other (videos and flash are totally supported in Chrome OS), it's not really a deal breaker for me. I was not really expecting this from such a cheap laptop.In terms of the hardware, I found the keyboard comparable in quality to the ones in recent models of the MacBook Air. The laptop itself, as you can see in the pictures, is pretty slim and lightweight, something I appreciate since I hate carrying around heavy laptops. The touchpad quality is good, but I do miss the support for a full range of gestures found in Apple's computers. One thing I do wish this laptop had is a larger SSD. 16 GB of storage means you will need to keep a lot of your data in an external drive (it's true Google does give you 100GB of free cloud storage for two years, but unless you have a really fast Internet connection, this is no replacement for a hard drive if you're moving around large files). Again, not a deal breaker for me, but something to keep in mind.Overall, it turned out to be an excellent laptop for me once I installed Crouton (and Ubuntu) on it.

431,"My son and I bought this for my husband. He didn't want an Ipad because he says its heavy and too awkward. So I wanted to get him something that was small, light weight, able to watch Netflix, Hulu etc.This was perfect. This laptop is a browser which works just fine for my husband. Nothing to install, no disc drive. Open the lid, log into your google account and voila! Simple. He can take it anywhere, very light, doesn't get hot. Battery lasts I believe 6 hours, we haven't tested that yet. The sound is loud which is perfect too. The graphics are nice.If your looking for simple, no bells and whistle, just a plain browser, this is the one!

432,"We got out 16 year old son the Chromebook for Christmas.  He opened the box, turned it on, and was up and going in about 2 minutes.  Our school district used GoogleDrive so he was able to get to all of his school work easily.  I know others say Netflix isn't working, but it does on his Chromebook.  He watched movies all night just this weekend.  It came right up when he logged in.  He loves that it is lightweight and he can take it to school in his backpack.  We have heard no complaints about the actual computer, but a few about our wireless, which he figured out on his own and fixed.  We purchased this Chromebook for him to be able to type papers and do research in his room or other places that you just can't take a desktop.  He still uses the desktop for his gaming, but has done all of his school papers and research on the Chromebook.  I can not review this myself, as I have not even been able to log into it as a guest because he is always on it.  We are going to purchase a second, maybe the Acer model for his little brother.

433,"Its been about a month and a half with this.Pros: Light (very light)  Useful for mainly online surfing and word processing with Google docs  Battery life - Its very long, but it also depends on your internet usage. I can vary from 4-7 hours (7 rarely) depending on what I am doing.Cons: Be very careful with how you handle this Chromebook as the SD card ""door"" can be broken. As I tend to be a bit rough with my computers I did not notice it until later. Make sure to have this Chromebook in a computer sleeve at the very least.  Heat - If you're going to be a bit heavy on the internet usage, it tends to become a bit warm (not too hot). It not that noticeable but if you're going to be having this on your lap it may become apparent. Remember that this has no cooling (given the size it would be rather difficult).Overall: A great computer for the price, while there is a minor issue with the heat (the SD card ""door"" issue being a my issue) it gets the job done for general online purposes and some offline (for just documents from the Google drive of the account). I don't find the size of the SSD to be an issue (as most of the things that I do on this is done online).

434,"I got this just for watching Amazon Instant Video because my Samsung Tab3 is not compatible. This chromebook had a hard time playing Youtube videos ( videos played choppy) but I could deal with that. After about 3 days of light use just watching movies it started crashing, it would shut off and restart itself about every 10-20 minutes and Shockwave flash would always crash. I tried resetting the chromebook to factory settings but it didnt help. I love Samsung products, every electronic I have it samsung and never had a problem with any of them until now, maybe I just got one of the few defective Samsung products.  FYI, itunes is not compatible with Chromebooks.

436,"I am a high school English teacher and avid Google user. I purchased the Samsung Chromebook (Wi-Fi, 11.6-Inch). For the price, it's a fantastic little laptop.My school purchased 30 Chromebooks and because my students have access to them I've gone 100% digital this quarter. The Google ""software"" does everything I need it to do:**Google Drive** :: Yes, it takes time (and lots of YouTubing/internet research) to figure out how to share folders but once I figured it out --- OH MY GOODNESS --- my teaching life changed. My students and I use Drive to store our work. They share their files with me and I can easily read/comment/edit/grade. We've even scheduled virtual conferences on their GDoc! I also use GForm to create a modified gradebook; students ""turnin"" their assignment via the GForm, copying/pasting the URL of their document. On my end, I see a Google Sheet (similar to Excel) where I see the information they wrote. I click on the link, read/comment on their ideas, then head back to the Sheet where I add another two columns, one for their grade and the other for my comments. No more paperwork, no more carrying huge bags. My Drive is organized, color-coded, and manageable. I'm a big fan.**Google Sites** :: I create my classroom website using Google Sites and it works beautifully for my purpose and audience. Again, it's not as intuitive but there are a ton of YouTube and GDoc tutorials. My students have complete access to all the files/folders we use in class. I've synced my Google Calendar on my site too.**Chromebook itself** :: Like the other reviewers noted, the laptop wakes/boots up super fast (<10 seconds), which I love. My old Macbook Pro took FOREVER to start up (then again, it's really old). Google Chrome syncs all my bookmarks (which I have a TON) too. I prefer to use Chrome over Firefox or IE or Safari. And the laptop is fast. I've opened 12+ tabs w/o delay. The volume isn't too bad; but then again, I'm not a consistent music/video streamer. Oh, and the 6-8 hr battery life is divine for the classroom.**Chrome webstore** :: It's growing and that's nice. I've added many of my favorite apps (e.g. Dropbox, Minesweeper, Evernote, Pandora, EasyBib) and have pinned the few I use consistently on my launcher.**OVERALL** :: My students and I collaborate on the Chromebooks three times a week and so far, it's been a positive experience. I've even had four seniors purchase their own Chromebooks for college. Yes, there are kinks and this laptop isn't a traditional laptop, but for the price and what it's able to do in my teaching classroom, the Samsung Chromebook is perfect.

439,"I received my Samsung Chromebook yesterday in the mail and I can already say that it is an awesome laptop. It seems to be really high quality, and it's just an amazing laptop in general. I'm a high school student so I really wanted a laptop that wasn't too big, worked fast, was light and thin, and was easy to write on and browse the internet--I got all of those things in this! I would highly recommend this for anyone, even older people. It's so simple to use, and the software is really good. People that prefer larger screens might not care for it, but I think it's the perfect size, and the good graphics and software make up for it I think. This laptop reminds me a lot of a Macbook. True to their word, the computer turns on in less than 8 seconds, and when it's in sleep mode and you open the lid it turns on in probably 2 seconds. The keyboard and mouse pad is really nice too. It might take a while to get used to some of the shortcuts you have to use on here, like the copy and paste, but I've already gotten the hang of it and it's really easy. The keyboard is really easy to type on, and I really like the feel of it. If you like keys that are more thick and press down more than you might not like this, but I think it's really good. I honestly have no complaints, and I wouldn't change anything. I have noticed that the screen and lid of the computer gets a little smudgy, but that was really no big deal for me and you can easily wipe it off with your sleeve or a cloth. Also I know that a lot of people use their computers to watch Netflix and or stream it onto their TV, and it works perfectly! I think the graphics are really good, and the sound really isn't bad at all. Since I've only had this for less than a day I'll write an update later on to say how I'm liking it and how it's holding up, but if you're looking for a fast and thin computer that won't get viruses, I think this would be the perfect laptop for you. They even give you a free 100GB storage for Google Drive that you can store photos, videos, and writing documents in, and I've found that really helpful.Here's a list of pros and cons I've come up with and then that's it! Hope this was helpful.PROS:-Very fast and reliable-Thin and light weight so you can easily carry it places-Pretty decent webcam so you can video chat with people-Updates software automatically so you always have the latest stuff-Easy for browsing the web and writing-Not very expensive!CONS:-No disk drive-No iTunes, only Google Music-You can't download games or software like Minecraft

I contacted the chrome ninja and despite my saying this was a new device, I received a cryptic reply that it was not a new device and did not qualify for the 100gb storage. BAD SERVICE!!!! I will update if they fix it. Update: cloud storage issue is fixed but it took a few emails. I researched the device but never saw that bluetooth was for mouse and keyboard only, not for headsets. A workaround could be a bluetooth transmitter into the headset jack, but it is a disappointment and likely won't work without a lag for videos. The screen isn't great but ok for the price. The device still is worth having with the fast internet and applications and no virus issues.

442,"I've had my chromebook for a couple months now, and I increasingly love it. I just pulled out my old laptop (heavy, slow MacBook) the other day, and I was really impressed by how much the Chromebook has spoiled me.Sure, you can't load your own 3rd party programs, and the storage is minimal, and the screen is not industry-leading... but you knew that all before you bought it!It's thin and super lightweight. The computer loads in seconds when powered on, and pages load faster that my old mac ever did. Not sure why everyone complains about the screen so much. Why is everyone looking at their screen from funny angles anyway?  Looks just fine when it's sitting in front of me.The Chrome web store has tons of add-ons which improve functionality. Memory hasn't been a problem for me at all; keep a flash drive around, and you'll be fine. Battery life has been at least 6-7 hours per charge, which is phenomenal. Completely silent while running, which is nice. Speakers are better than I expected. HDMI link to my 42"" LCD TV has very nice picture. Keyboard has a very nice feel to it, and trackpad works well. 12 free GoGo in-flight passes almost pay for the machine itself.Crashed on me twice shortly after I got it; probably had too many windows/tabs open (may have something to do with combination of having both incognito and regular windows open... not sure). Software has updated itself several times since I first started using it, and now no more crashes. Couldn't open my dropbox files at first; after upgrades, it's working perfectly. I do wish Google and/or Citrix could develop a better app than their current Citrix Receiver, which is really my only complaint. That would really help make this a dynamite cloud-friendly computer.At $250, this is an incredible value. Really glad I stepped outside my Mac and PC comfort zone to make this purchase. Careful: if you lend it to your family and friends for a ""minute,"" it may be hours or days before you see it again. :)

I have had nothing but good experiences with Samsung products, and this little laptop is no exception.If you are looking for a mega computer with a lot of storage options and large game playing capability, this isn't for you but if you are looking for a little laptop to surf the next, play casual games and minor office abilities then this is for you.The only con for me is the inability to really use Skype.

Considering that this machine is designed for exclusive internet use, this 3 bugs are unforgivable. The online solutions that I've read about are overly complicated, and there seems to be no consensus on what works to correct these problems. It's been happening to me since day 1 with the machine, so I'm not taking any of the blame for it.I'll continue to use my Chromebook, because I just bought it, and it's my only computer at the moment, but I am unsatisfied with this purchase.

457,"Pros: Very easy to use, great solid keyboard, a few keys missing compared to a full keyboard but combo-keys easily fix that (example, no delete key, but alt-backspace works as delete), can do all my non-business day-to-day things on my chromebook.  I easily sync using GoogleDrive, Dropbox, SkyDrive and Evernote, so I have just about immediate access to all the files I need anytime as long as I'm connected to a network.  Ability to put into full-screen mode using [shift + screen] buttons to maximize viewing space and that works pretty well.  No moving parts so it should be more durable and battery lasts longer - I think this laptop is better than the cheaper Acer chromebook, which has a spinning hard disk.  Battery life is fantastic, it's lightweight, doesn't get hot, and I can use the small solid state hard drive to download/upload files between my accounts.Cons: Audio is poor, viewing the screen from an angle (from sides or above/below) is not great, and the hinge in the back prevents the screen from tilting back more than 45% (which is only an issue because of the usable viewing screen angle).  Can't print using USB connections, instead have to use network printer (not an issue for me, but might be for some). Can't replace my business laptop because Microsoft Office applications (powerpoint and excel for me) have no good online equivalent - online version of Office is limited and far too slow (although I can view any Office document using SkyDrive, which is nice since Google sheets and slides can't always render the images well).Overall, I think this is a great product that fills a niche use for me - everyday use at home and going out to a cafe to work.  It's definitely a value play and can't deliver on all the features I need for business, but they don't market it as such anyway.  I never use this without being on a network, so I can't comment on its offline utility.  I'd buy this again in a second.

I could buy the latest MS Office software, but I'm going to see what the options are first.Otherwise, I've only had one recent moment where the CB didn't boot (for unknown reasons), in Mammoth Lakes, California. The CB is light, fast and very capable. Storing things in the cloud instead of on the machine's hard drive is a comparatively new option for me, but I'm working up the learning curve and enjoying the technology.So...I'm ""all in"" with the CB, and encourage others who are looking for a new notebook machine to give it a try. Can't beat the functionality for the price. Really!

459,"I ordered this on Monday after watching a lot of video reviews and reading a lot about it, so I knew what to expect. So far, I love it! I've only had it for about 5 hours, so I can't say much about it yet, but here are my initial thoughts:Pros:- Battery life is AWESOME! I had it fully charged about 5 pm, and five hours later I'm still going. I haven't had it on the entire time, but I haven't plugged it back in, either, just put it to sleep. I still have 50% charge. My Toshiba laptop would have NEVER made it this long without a charge.- Super fast setup.- Ridiculously fast boot time. Wow, it's amazing!- Quiet! Love how quiet it is. No noisy fan.- Specialized buttons. I haven't gotten to use all of them, but I love having a key for mute and volume. My Asus laptop didn't have this, which was really annoying.- Great trackpad. I'm normally an external mouse kind of person, but this is a trackpad I can actually use. It's nice and responsive, and I love how you can click anywhere on it, rather than having to click an actual button.- Light! I stupidly bought a 17"" screen laptop for college. I never took it to school because it killed my back, adding about 6 pounds to my backpack. This thing is amazingly light and is going to save me a million times over.Cons:- I hate the power jack/power cord. It's so tiny and wee. I have power jack issues on almost every piece of technology I buy, for some reason, even though I'm really careful. I'm nervous about this one. Luckily, the fact that the charge lasts so long might mean I spend a lot less time with it plugged in, negating the wear on it that my other laptops end up having from being constantly charging.- I had a lot of trouble syncing Chrome from my other computer. I still haven't quite sorted it out, as nearly everything synced but my bookmarks, but I'm dealing with it. My help email from Chrome said that I must be using an old version of a device but...I just bought this today so I hope it's not an old version!-It's warmer on the bottom than I expected based on reviews. It's definitely cooler than my laptop, so I'm not sure that it's fair to list this as a con, but after all the hype about how cool it was, I was expecting miracles I guess. So not really much of a con, just something to let people know...it's not AS cool on the bottom as they say.Many of the complaints I read other people having weren't things I was concerned about. No delete button? I'm okay with that. No Skype? Totally cool with that, I've never Skyped and don't plan to. No Caps lock? Sweet. I was always accidentally hitting that without needing it, because how often do I really need to type in all caps? No page up/page down? Meh. I used it occasionally, but it's not a concern for me. I do agree with a commenter I saw who said this thing needs a .com button. YES! All computers should have that nowadays, I don't know why they don't.I'm also cool with not having an actual operating system. I bought this for college, and I like Google Docs. I love not worrying that I idiotically forgot to hit save, or that my computer crashed and my paper died. Google Docs is great for that. Screen quality is just fine for me. I've seen some complaints about viewing angle, but I guess my other computers must have sucked, too, because I always had to tilt them just right to see what I was watching. Same with this.This is DEFINITELY worth the $249 I paid for it. I've heard it called a glorified tablet with a keypad...I guess. So far I don't feel like that. It really feels like a laptop and I keep waiting to run into the limitations of it.I always kind of roll my eyes at the people I see on campus pulling out their iPad, and their iPad stand, and their iPad keyboard, and spending 5 minutes getting it all set up and positioned on their desk...good grief, if you are going to do all that get a laptop! Better yet, get this. So much cheaper and easier to manage, even if it isn't as flashy or name-brandy.

460,"First I have to be honest: this chromebook was a gift for my 5 years old kid, his first ""computer"", able to browse tons of online games.[Stage 1]First thing I did has been placing the right bookmarks in the chrome bar. Oh, yeah, first I had to switch its power on. Damn, it's so fast to boot! I knew it was fast, never imagined SO fast! Well, it's just a browser with more options to choose from, but everything is easy to find, in 10-15 min to do almost everything. My kid was obviously very to happy on Xmas day, and started to play his games and to browse on WWE's website in just a few seconds. Now, every evening when going to bed he asks me ""dad... milk, water and charge my computer"" (even if the working time is so long, most of the time I didn't do that).[Stage 2]As an ICT professional, my work is also to find, test and suggest the best available solutions for my customers. From day 1, when the chromebook showed up in my hands, it was immediately clear in my mind a new ICT winning approach was in front of me! My daily notebook is a 15"" macbook pro, and I'm very happy with that. But having something so light, fast and easy to maintain is astonishing. I've already started to browse the available apps/extensions for chrome, really huge. Maybe a bigger screen size would have been better for my needs, but it's so comfortable in this small size that it's ok. Just worth to mention that a couple of CIOs, friend of mine, decided to buy the same for their personal usage after a few minutes of talks and tests.Some cons are the keyboard without a light under it (I like it a lot in my mbp) and a general ""too light"" sensation about the plastic. For example, if I pull it up from one corner, with the screen up, the (little) weight makes the horizontal length to the other corner to curve a little bit. Nothing special, but enough to be worried the first times you see it.Definitely a must buy, now waiting the upcoming LG desktop chromebase!

461,"I bought a Chromebook primarily for online homework assignments, browsing the internet, watching YouTube videos, and occasionally writing documents.  Basically just normal work that doesn't require me to be chained to my desktop computer constantly.  I purchased an iPad Mini for these tasks but it's not functional enough (especially when it comes to typing anything) and it isn't great for multitasking.  This device fulfills all of these roles perfectly.  The Chromebook boots super fast, is very lightweight, is responsive for the most part, and looks really nice. The design is Apple-esque without the premium price tag.  Google's version of Microsoft Office has been more than capable of handling my assignments.My complaints are that the build could be a little sturdier (it looks like a Mac but doesn't have that level of design quality) especially in regards to the power and USB outlets, which seem a little flimsy and prone to accidental damage.  I definitely found it worthwhile to invest in the Square Trade accidental damage warranty.  I'm not very fond of the trackpad as it can be sluggish and uncomfortable to use.  I use a small USB mouse instead. The Chromebook can also get a little bogged down by too many applications running at once.  A higher screen resolution wouldn't hurt but I'm not complaining when the computer is this affordable.I've really come to appreciate cloud computing after using this device and agree that it is the way of the future.  Most computer owners (except for PC gamers, movie enthusiasts and photo or video editors) don't really need tons of physical storage space and can instead make great use of the ease and accessibility of cloud storage.  I can access all of my documents and files on Google Drive and all of my music on Google Play from any computer, phone, or tablet.  And there are many other free services out there that fulfill these same purposes!Overall, the Chromebook is a fast, lightweight device with an excellent price tag that is more than capable of handling the needs of the average computer user.

462,"Went back to college, wanted something light and compact and NOT Windows based.  Been using it for almost a month now and I love it.  Built in virus protection and it automatically updates Chrome so you always have the latest version.  Tons of apps, too.  I also love that it boots up in less than 10 seconds, I put in my password, and it is loaded.  No waiting for Microsoft Windows to load, which seems to take forever.

463,"I had a Macbook Pro and finally died on me. I didn't want to spend that much money on another laptop that I primarily only use for web, email, music, and pictures. So I heard good things about the Chromebook, so I decided to give it a try. I couldn't be happier.Positives: The keyboard is comparable to the Macbook, it has the same feel, and love that each key is spaced out and not crammed all together.  It is lightweight and for being smaller, it still feels very durable. Lastly it does not heat up, which is amazing when it is on my lap for the majority of the time.Negatives:The picture is not has HD or clear as the Macbook.  The speakers are not great on this, but I mean I hook up side speakers to it anyway if I want to listen to music. If you are just watching something on YouTube it serves its purpose. But if you are in a room full of people, the volume isn't great.Overall I would highly recommend this for the money! Great purchase. Have had it about 2 months now and love it!

464,"I've had this for a year, and I love how lightweight and quick it is, as well as the impressive battery life.  The only thing is that now after 13 months of heavy use, the ""click"" has gone out of the touchpad - it still functions, but it doesn't make that ""click"" sound or spring back up like it used to.2-year update: battery still gets 6 hours of life; the protective coating on the touchpad has started peeling off, but it still works underneath; the screen will periodically take on a cyan tint and then clear up again at random, after a drop from about 12 inches.

I like the reasonable size and light weight. I'm still sort of surprised that there's no fan. It's quick on my home wi-fi system, although I haven't taken it out in public yet and suspect that a slower signal could slow it down. Still, it's nice to have a keyboard again and something that can work with my chromecast besides my phone. Reasonable price, too. I haven't tried out the google drive yet because I don't have a whole lot of things I need to save on the cloud, but I suspect I'll like that just fine, too.

Being a commuter in Chicago, I was beyond tired of carrying not only my books, but my heavy 15in laptop around when I needed to work on assignments away from home. This little laptop is so light and beyond functional. I already use Google Chrome and Gmail, so setting up the computer took as long as signing in to my Google account. It even remembered all my bookmarks from the Google Chrome I had on my laptop. You can also download many of the apps that you use on your Google Play Android phone. I love it. I think this school year will be awesome with this laptop.

468,"Bought the Samsung Chromebook as a gift for my mom. I think it's perfect for her because it's very simple to use, starts up and shuts down fast. Keyboard and touchpad is very much like a macbook -simplistic design, scroll with two fingers, I believe...right click holding ""alt."" It's a chrome browser plus apps in case you want games on the device for when no wifi is available. Very much like a tablet with a full size keyboard -without touch screen. Like I said...good if all you want is something simple to use for leisure.Here's my personal opinion and why I gave it just 3 stars.Essentially, I need more. Chromebook didn't quite hit the spot even though I had high hopes for it. Honestly, if you have a good smart phone - I wouldn't recommend getting this product.Cosmetically - the Chromebook (CB) seems/feels cheap.1. The screen was smaller than expected.2. speakers are @ bottom of CB corners -so sound is muffled when placed on the lap/sofa/bed. Hard surfaces are ok.3. With lid closed, there's the hinge bar thing that runs on top of the notebook (I'm referring to the part that connects the top half to bottom half -and the photos dont reeeally show it). So basically, when you run your hands over the top of the CB there's a long horizontal bump - just not aesthtically pleasing.4. NOT BALANCED. w/ lid opened, it is BACK HEAVY. no joke, I almost dropped/flipped this device several times while shifting my legs about. When you want to show someone something on the screen, you have to hold or support the back part.I hope 3 & 4 made sense. If not, I HIGHLY SUGGEST going to a store and testing it out yourself.Other cons:1. DOES NOT STREAM NETFLIX!!!! ...yet -it's in the works.2. It gets warm. Some reviews said it the CB stayed cool. I streamed HULU and Youtube for about 30 mins, and it felt like the machine was working for hours. It got to a pretty warm temperature.3. Touchpad is not as good - there's more drag.4. The CB starts up in super bright setting, regardless of what previous setting was (until login screen). So BEWARE when you're in a dark space.5. SETTINGS - takes you to the Chrome site to adjust - feels limiting.That's all for now, hope this is helpful.

469,"I had heard good things about the Chromebook both online and through several friends, and I have been a huge fan of Samsung as I love my Galaxy 10.1 tablet. The Chromebook was delivered to work, and I immediately unpacked it, plugged it in and started using it on my project. Set-up was a breeze, and it connected easily to the network. Lightweight, attractive, and well built - it was immediately impressive. The only down-side is it wants a wifi network to do anything; in my case, that is no problem at all. I use SSH (from app store (and free) and browser daily. Also several favorite games were also in the app store.If you are looking for near-laptop functionality and much lower cost, take a look at the Chromebook.

In the last few weeks my battery life has halved, which I assume means I just got a faulty battery. I'm going to get it replaced under the guarantee, but don't let that take away from how great this computer actually is. It's super light, has good battery life (until recently) and can do most of the things you want to do with it.I also installed Ubuntu alongside Chrome OS using Crouton. It runs really smoothly and is a great way to get more out of the Chromebook

I can't figure out the drag and drop, and sometimes it won't play plug ins on Facebook, but so what.  Its quick start up, silence and thin lightness are worth every penny.  Anyone thinking about this should get it for sure, even if just for the portability.

The size is practical for my 12 year old, and a great first lap top. She is able to do all that she needs on the chromebook as i do on my HP Laptop. Its easy to navigate as we have Samsung phones as well and the applications/icons are familiar. I bought a Neoprene case to carry this Chromebook in- its so much easier than hauling around a regular laptop! Although i bought this for my daughter to use to keep her off my laptop, i have a feeling that this mommy will be borrowing the chromebook more often than using the laptop! Ha Ha! Paybacks! And honestly? YOU CANT BEAT THE PRICE. I was able to afford the 2 year "" bumper to bumper"" warranty for the chromebook since the cost wasnt outrageous or expensive.

473,"I was looking for something to travel with and be able to connect to the internet, do emailing, some light surfing and maybe type up a few things for work.  I kept looking at various styles of tablets, ""phablets"" and net books.  I didn't want to invest a serious amount of money into a laptop since it wouldn't be something to completely replace my desktop PC, but something to use while on the go.  After months of researching and testing various items, I settled on a Chromebook.  After speaking with several people ""in the know"" about them, I chose to get this Samsung version.Here are a few things that might help you make your decision that absolutely did influence mine :1) You get what you pay for.  Yes Walmart has an Acer version of the Chromebook for $199, but it's kind of shoddy.  Everyone I spoke with had only negative things to say about Acer products and how cheaply they are built.  This version by Samsung for this price point is an absolute steal.2) Don't expect it to replace your fancy Mac laptop (or any other high-end laptop).  It's essentially a tablet on steroids with a built in keyboard.  The OS is very simple to use and understand... even more-so if you are a regular Android user (via phone or tablet).3)  Play Store is your friend !  You can find all kinds of helpful (and also free) apps to download to make your Chromebook even better.  Some apps you might have to pay for ... such is life... but you can seriously bulk up on almost anything you want from the Play Store.  If you have an Android phone and love the things you can add, then you will love being able to put most of the same programs on this.4)  YOU CAN'T STREAM AUDIO VIA BLUETOOTH.... yet.  One drawback that I didn't find out about until after purchase is that YES you can connect to Bluetooth for printing and some headsets that enable chat, but that's it.  Not able to connect to Bluetooth enabled speakers.  That is kind of a drag since I love streaming music, however I do have other means to accomplish this no problem.  However it does bring me to the next issue...5)  The speakers (located on the bottom of the Chromebook) are kind of quiet.  It doesn't get really loud no matter if everything is turned up full blast.  I've found the best way to watch movies or listen to music with it is to simply bring along wired headphones.  That to me is the biggest reason I wanted to connect to a Bluetooth enabled speaker, so that I could watch movies without headphones.  According to chatter on the Google Groups forums though, this is a known issue that Google is working on and hopefully will be addressed and rectified via update soon (connection via Bluetooth for speakers, not increasing the current speaker volume).6)  I bought the $249 Wi-Fi version.  I have no idea how well the 3G version is with internet, but with the Wi-Fi one, simply connect to a Wi-Fi signal and it runs great.  Smooth and fast with no issues at all.  Even viewing Netflix or Amazon Prime Instant has been great with no loading or buffering issues.  It does have the port to install an internet card on your own though, so if you happen to have or purchase one then you are good to go.7)  The touch-pad for the mouse works fine, but you can easily connect a wireless mouse (or wired) as well.  It also has a built in webcam if you fancy such a bonus.8)  It charges fast and holds a charge for a LONG time.  Compared to the other Chromebook versions, this Samsung version has the longest battery life (claims 6.5 hours, mine has been good for up to 8).  The nice thing is where the battery icon is on screen, if you just click it with your mouse it tells you the battery status.  Good info too, not just ""45% battery"".  It actually tells you exactly how much time (say 4h 23m) left before the battery dies.  If you plug it in to charge, it will even tell you how much time until the battery is fully charged.9)  It seriously starts-up and shuts-down in less than 10 seconds.  So far I've been timing the start-ups at about 5 seconds each.  It's super fast and kind of surprising.10)  Lastly, it looks good.  The case, the keyboard, the screen.. it's all great.  Smooth and sexy as they say.Those are all my impressions after having it for a decent amount of time now.  I was highly skeptical at first because I've been a die-hard PC user for years and never really liked laptops or tablets, but this has completely sold me.  Not only would I say this is a great travel computer for work or school... but this would be AMAZING for kids (especially college aged ones).  You really can use Google Docs with this to do pretty much any homework / paperwork and you get 100 GB of cloud storage with it for free.  Combining this with any other Google things you use (phones, Gmail, Drive, Chrome OS) it syncs everything together wonderfully.  It even lets you sign is as different users so you can have multiple people use the device with their own settings and info and keeps them from messing up your stuff.All in all, I would highly recommend this product.  Worst case scenario, if you're not in love with it... well Amazon has an excellent return policy and their customer service is always astounding so there is no need to be worried about getting stuck with something you don't like.

476,"Samsung Chromebook (Wi-Fi, 11.6-Inch)More affordable than Apple's iPod Touch(!), the Samsung XE303C12-A01US Chromebook will likely become the game-changer in the MacBook Air/Wintel Ultrabook category of personal computing. This Chromebook has achieved a remarkable market position when one considers the combination of its competitive price-point, seamless cloud-based performance and battery life, and appealing hardware design that makes even the $999 low-end MacBook Air look like a massive rip-off.Yes, Samsung's XE303C12 does not (yet- see Gmail Offline) run well-known applications from its local storage, and privacy may be a concern with its cloud-based storage of user data. But this gain in convenience usually comes at some reduction in security, especially in the new paradigm of cloud computing. The convenience gain: data backup and operating system maintenance procedures are now automatic and free-of-charge, and damage or theft to your computer will not result in major data loss. Just change your Google password and buy another reasonably-priced $249 Chromebook and your worries are minimized. Of course, more secure computing alternatives will always have its adherents, but for general users (students, digital immigrant family members, tech-savvy children), this Chromebook will provide a welcome relief to the premium hardware ""tax"" that comes with most of Apple's popular computing products.Microsoft Office fans will be delighted to know that limited web-based versions of Word, Excel, and Powerpoint programs can be used free-of-charge through the Chrome browser using the free (for the first 7GB) SkyDrive storage service. Ah, the free benefits of the cloud computing era!  Will this emerging low-cost personal computing paradigm spell the end of the Apple/Microsoft business model dominance? It remains to be seen, but I, for one, am grateful in beginning my investigation and eventual investment in Google's open-source, low-cost, innovative ecosystem that facilitates the development of 21st century digital skills for the overall empowerment of the masses...and yes, I am writing this review on my new Samsung Chromebook!

What I found was most people had no idea what they were purchasing when they ordered this, but if you look at the SPECS it's pretty clear. It's more of a super basic Netbook of sorts in which all of the programs are Google/Internet based. So if you don't like those two things, well find something else. But if all you need is something portable for Internet and email and the occasional document on GoogleDocs, it works fine. As for the ""fragile"" factor. I travel a lot to/from Philadelphia and the burbs. I take the train and had a basic case without a bunch of insulation and didn't have any problems. I suggest just being careful with it honestly.The ONLY reason I didn't give it 5 stars is really more personal. I have a vision disability and so the accessibility features weren't all that I wanted them to be, but that's why it was only temporary for me. Hope this helps! :)

I was even more impressed when I saw my music library from my android phone was available to me right away because I buy my songs from the Google play store. The keyboard is the perfect size and the touchpad is great once you get used to it. The display is crisp with adjustable brightness that can get very bright if need be. Everything seems to run very fast and very smoothly. People complain about the limited storage, but I happen to like Google Drive so that is a non-issue for me.

479,"I've been using this laptop for work and recreation for over a year now. Initially, I loved it, and after a year I still like it but my particular machine (and most likely many others) has problems.Firstly, when opening the laptop lid with the charger plugged in will always result on a black screen. This is fixed by removing the charger, shutting the lid, and then re-opening the lid. It's a minor inconvenience but it is still a gripe.Secondly, after about 14 months of owning the product the screen is starting to get fuzzy. This again is easily fixed by changing the angle of the monitor until the fuzzy screen disappears. A minor complaint but still something that often gets in the way.The chromebook landscape is (thankfully) a very fluid hardware market and at this point I would recommend to buy another chromebook elsewhere. After a year of using ChromeOS I'm excited at the prospect of buying another chromebook, however, I'm still waiting until this one dies. It is unfortunate to think that it shouldn't be too much longer until this one kicks the bucket.In summation: This was an adequate device when this was first released. Buy a chrome device - just not this one.

The simplicity of the Chromebook is that it's built to browse the web, and it does it very well with a great battery life. I typically get in excess of seven hours of battery life from my Samsung Chromebook. I've only booted up my Dell laptop ONCE since I received this Samsung Chromebook on 12/21 - and I only did it to host some pictures.I use a Dell laptop for work purposes (I work in an office of ~30 people), and the boot time drives me crazy every time I have to reboot it since I'm used to pressing power and being up and running in less than 20 seconds.Positives of the Samsung ARM Chromebook:1) Battery life: 7 hours in my usage2) Fast bootup/shutdown times (20 seconds/under 5 seconds)3) Ease of operating from the cloud (if you have any issues, you lose practically nothing with a reset)4) The weight (at ~2.3 pounds, it's noticeably lighter than other computers I've used)5) The keyboard is GREAT.Negatives:1) Video playback does leave a good bit to be desired. Netflix does not work at this point.2) The screen is average. No more and no less. It's a $249 laptop screen.3) The case of the computer has scratched on the bottom, and I do fear that the top will eventually meet the same fate.Feel free to comment with any questions and I'll be glad to attempt to help out.

485,"We got this for my spouse's use. I was worried that the processor speed seemed a bit under powered by today's standards, and I was worried about the hard drive size since we do not have regular access to the internet. However, a purchase of a 64GB portable SSD has remedied that. The processor is quite sufficient and powers through quite a bit and the battery life is fantastic. My laptop battery stopped holding a charge a few years ago, so maybe I am a bit over enthusiastic, but the Chromebook gets 8 to 10 hours so far and even when the battery bar is really low it can still get 2 hours.I do a lot of programming, but if I can find the tools and programs I need, I definitely want to buy one of these for myself!

487,"My mom who is in her early 60's was looking for a new laptop after her Acer Netbook that she had had for a few years bit the dust. We had contemplated a tablet, because she has an iPhone and that would have been pretty much the same thing, but the price tag for even an iPad mini was way more that what she was wanting to spend! We went to BestBuy and played around with a few computers, but even those were upwards of $400 which she still wasn't quite comfortable with because she wasn't sure she'd use it enough to justify the price, so we left empty handed. Then I remembered hearing good things about the Chromebook, so I looked it up here on Amazon, showed her some pictures and explained the concept, and she was willing to try it out. We ordered it on Monday and it arrived today-- I literally opened the box, flipped open the lid of the Chromebook and it powered up instantly. I was very impressed! It prompted for language, and then to connect to a wireless network, and for a gmail address which my mom doesn't have (she still uses AOL! haha) so I made her a gmail address that's the same as her AOL SN-- I noticed there was also an option to ""browse as guest"" if someone didn't have a gMail account. I was on the internet setting up bookmarks for her facebook and amazon in literally 2 minutes after opening the box! If you're going to be doing extensive work I would say you will probably need something more powerful-- but for someone like my mom who doesn't need all the bells and whistles, just a nice machine to browse the internet and check e-mails, facebook, etc with a REAL keyboard-- the Chromebook is awesome!!! I have a Dell Inspiron Notebook that's about 4 years old, and after using this Chromebook I think I might get one too. It feels a lot like a macbook in a way, but at 1/10 of the price at least! I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants something simple to use, convenient, lightweight, and awesome looking!!!

488,"I've had my Chromebook about three weeks now. So far I haven't found anything that I can't do on it. Of course it's not for gamers. but hey, I'm not in to games. The ability to create and save documents in the cloud could not be any easier. Once you open a blank document, you don't even have to think about it, it gets saved automatically. I pay bills, access bank accounts, make purchases online, basically anything you can do on a laptop or desktop can be done with the Chromebook. Granted, you get what you pay for, i.e. small screen. But, the light weight, long battery life, and low heat make up for all of that.

489,"My review will be brief. I started doing IT in 1982 so am no stranger to having my hands on hardware. The Samsung Chromebook rivals the Kindle Fire as the best bang for your buck. Both are probably heavily subsidized by the seller, meaning that you are almost buying the hardware at cost. The Chromebook has the best keyboard my hands have ever touched. If you live in the Cloud like I do, you just gotta buy a Chromebook. I have no regrets or negatives to report. Love it.

490,"No Windows 8 to mess around with, what's not to love? I like this Chromebook better than my tablet. It does everything I want it to do with ease. It's not a full fledged laptop so don't expect that for this type of money. Great for checking e-mails, social networking, playing games etc. The only way this could have been improved would have been by the addition of Skype. Skype is not available and does not work on the Chromebook. That's not to say it won't some time in the future but right now it doesn't!! Still a great deal for the money

The downside is that you cannot load programs on it and there are limits to the functionality.  It is a great price for a basic computer, but definitely has some drawbacks for those of us who would like to access other programs.

As soon as I turn it on, there are horizontal lines across the screen that make it impossible to use. It seems to be a physical problem with the connection between the motherboard and screen or with the motherboard itself.

495,"I bought this Chromebook with the knowledge that it will only do the Google apps and internet surfing...I do not have a problem with that.  My issue is that it is very, very SLOW if not plugged in!  I completely charged the battery, but when on the internet, it keeps getting stuck.  I need to refresh, and/or wait...wait...and wait.  Then, I tried it while plugged in.  It works better- faster.  Slower than my Macbook, of course, but it will go from site to site without delay.  This just does not make sense to me.  I'm not thrilled with the monitor display, but again, I knew that I was not buying a high-end laptop.  I like the keyboard, and it's size is just right.  I needed this to use at home as my Macbook is for and from my place of employment.  Therefore, I only wanted something for email, internet, and a few other jobs I can easily do on Google apps.  I am just disappointed with it's internet speed and fluency when using the battery.  Could I have a faulty battery?  I would not think that should matter, but it does.  Huge difference when I use the cord and plug in.  I have so many days to return it; I may do just that. :(

496,"Let me start by saying I am a Google guy. I have a Droid, a Nexus 7 and now this. I love the convenience of Google Drive and I store my music in the cloud. I love Google.Having said that, I bought this mostly so I could do work for school when I am not sitting at a PC (ie when I am in the living room watching The Walking Dead). It is perfect for that function. I can easily access and edit all of my documents on Google Drive, and then they are automatically saved when I log in at school to print or use them.I am not much of a tech guy, but the monitor looks nice. I have watched YouTube videos on it without any noticeable issues. The keyboard is great (as some people have pointed out). The touchpad takes some getting used to (for example, right-clicking is done by clicking down with 2 fingers at the same time), but it is growing on me. The speakers fill my kitchen with sound from Pandora when I am cooking no problem.Adding apps, like Pandora, to Chrome is a snap and the desktop stays uncluttered because the apps are all housed online and not on the machine. I have not had to use it offline yet, so I cannot really comment on that.I should also mention that setup was a breeze. If you know your Google account login and the password to your router, you can set this up in under 10 minutes (not including time to download any updates, which you would have to do with any new computer). It also starts up every bit as fast as it says it does when you turn it on or wake it up.On the whole, this is a great deal for anyone who needs/wants a laptop for going online, listening to music through Pandora or Google Play, and already is using Google Drive/Docs. I do not think I would recommend this to someone who is not familiar with using Google (ie Droid) beforehand, as I would imagine it would add some additional learning time that may turn some people off.UPDATE (10/21/13) - I have had this thing for almost a year . . . and I still love it. No slow down at all. I am getting much more comfortable using Google Docs and apps for everything, and people are constantly asking me about it. I would honestly suggest this to anyone looking for a low cost laptop for work or school.

497,"I LOVE it!  I bought it primarily for travel because I wanted something small and light.  I'm now also using it as a second laptop when my kids are using the other one.  I got my unit about a month after I ordered it.The unit starts up immediately upon opening, and shuts off in three seconds.  The body isn't quite as pretty as Macbook Air due to the awkward hinge.  The wireless connection is strong and it never drops a signal.  HDMI seems to function well.  I was able to stream ESPN3 onto my TV without problem.  I'll focus my review on the 3G feature since I haven't seen too many reviews on it.3G FeatureThe 3G feature was easy to set up.  Once you click on the setup box on the bottom right of your screen, it takes you to a  VerizonWireless site where you register online with various plan options.  It also assigns what looks to be a phone number for the account.  I selected the free option which gives you 100MB of data/mos. for two years.  The couple of other options I recall seeing are one that's based on the amount of data you select that expires after 30-days, and an unlimited data for a day for about $10.  Nice to have when you've exhausted your free allowance and you're in need of connection.  Having the flexibility to buy only the amount of data for as long as you want is a great option to have because it doesn't force you to commit to a long-term deal.  And since its Verizon, the coverage should be excellent.  I've been using the 3G for almost a month now, primarily to check my personal email at work, and so far I haven't run out of my monthly allowance yet.  For a paltry premium of $80 over the wifi unit, what you get from the 3G unit is not only 100MB of data, but more importantly, access to 3G Verizon network.  Most of the time, I'm on wifi, so the plan works for me. When you're in an area without wifi, it automatically connects to 3G.The unit also comes with 12 free sessions of Gogo inflight internet access on a plane.  Each session, if purchased separately, costs $14 so its quite a deal!  When you start your Chrome on a flight with wifi and select Gogo, it'll recognize your unit and also recognize how many sessions are remaining.  You punch in a security code on the screen and you're on line.  It's that easy.  I had a chance to use it twice on couple of American flights and it worked great.  The only down side is that the signal on the plane is not sufficient to stream video.  I tried to watch a movie on Amazon Prime and it took so long to load the video that I gave up.  I also tried to do a video chat with my daughter using Google+.  I was able to talk with her and send IM, but the video portion didn't come through, although toward the end of our short session, my daughter did tell me that she was able to see the old man.  I did watch a movie via hotel wifi off of Amazon Prime without much problem, so I'm sure it was the signal on the plane that was lacking.The only drawback for me was the quality of the screen.  I would've gladly paid another $50 to have a better screen than the one they put in.  I suspect it'll be fine for most folks, but for someone getting on in years and one that needs a new eyeglass prescription, it may be a small issue.  For that, I'm knocking off 0.5 star.I also ordered the Case Logic 12.1"" Laptop Sleeve.  At first I wasn't sure if I would like the handle because it looks a bit dorky.  But it's working out good because with the power cord in the front pocket, it's not easy to store it in a brief case.With every iteration, technology seem to be getting better.  This is one very impressive unit - especially for the cost.

All I really do is surf the net and work on my documents and this is sufficient. One major thing to note: some programs that you may be used to (such as iTunes) are not compatible with Chromebook.

Since I do not always want to hang out down there by myself (have fiance and 9 month old) its great to have this little device upstairs with me at all  times.

515,"I think the idea behind this device  is great, to have a system that is pared down and just for Internet, email, watching non-HD videos on Youtube, and the like.  I am using a netbook that I bought 3 years ago, using WinXP,and it has slowed down badly over time.  Can't even play Youtube videos without stuttering any more, sometimes to the point where I give up trying to watch.  If the chromebook can deliver a device that won't have that problem, I'd love it.  So that's why I bought it.  The execution of the idea, I found, has a couple issues.  First, I had some difficulties with the keyboard and trackpad.  And then I found out that the particular device I had is defective.  Those two issues are discussed in more detail, in the next two paragraphs.I only used this device for a few hours last evening, when it functioned normally.  It was pretty nice then, with a nice bright screen and everything very intuitive and easy to use.  On the downside, I thought the cursor movement in response to the trackpad was a bit slow, even after I found the ""settings"" and set it for max speed.  Also, Chrome doesn't seem to have a setting that makes the cursor fly all the way to the edge of a window once you have set it in motion, which you get with Windows.  The cursor only moves as long as your finger is in contact with the trackpad and moving.  However, the trackpad does have 2-finger scrolling, and a tap with 2 fingers gives you a ""right click,"" which are nice features.  I was going to keep the device and study up on all the features, and I figured it would get easier for me to use with practice on this particular keyboard and trackpad.Unfortunately, this morning I discovered that my unit is defective.  On the third boot-up, the trackpad had stopped working.  The cursor would barely respond, if at all, to finger movements across the trackpad.  Samsung customer service is good, BTW (this is my 2d Samsung laptop).  I got them on the phone, and these were the troubleshooting steps they had me try:  (1) re-boot - which I had already tried before phoning them, (2) tap the ""escape"" key several times - no change there (3) do a ""drumroll"" with two fingers on the trackpad - no joy (4) do a factory reset, using the following keys, held down together:  Shift - Ctrl - Alt - R.  After the factory reset (which the Chromebook calls a ""powerwash"") the trackpad became responsive for a minute or two.  But before I could even get back to connecting with my wifi, it cut out again.Bottom line:  I would have liked to use this device for a longer period of time before reviewing it.  Based on what I was able to do with it, I felt it was about a 3 - 4 because of my criticisms of the keyboard and trackpad that I wrote in paragrah 2.  In light of the defect in this example of the system, I'm going with 3 stars.  I'll send this back for refund, and apply the money to getting a PC or Mac.  I'm glad there is a 3d choice out there now, but at the moment I guess it is not for me.Edit, later on: I didn't get the device packed up and sent back right away, so I gave it one more chance last evening. Starting over from the most recent reset to factory settings, I used it to edit text, happily, for a few hours. I take back what I said about ""not enough travel in the keys."" I seem to have adjusted, and the typing was OK. BUT, once the power got low enough for the device to prompt me to plug it in - bam, as soon as I plugged in the power supply, the trackpad stopped working properly again. So today, the device went back to Amazon, for credit. Don't worry, Amazon, I'll probably buy the Windows system from you later, anyway.

516,"I was very happy with my Chromebook, which I purchased primarily for travel, until I took it out of the country. Google, entirely for my protection, of course, would not let me sign in because I wasn't where I was supposed to be. I was instructed to provide a local phone number so Google could call and confirm I was me. Since I use an international sim card when I'm traveling and usually don't have local phone numbers and Google wouldn't accept my international number, the only access I had to the Internet was as a guest which meant there was no browsing history and no access to the bookmarks that link me to important travel information.Does Google understand how ridiculous this is? It gathers reams of information on its users which it provides to government agencies, sells to advertisers and uses for its own profit. And then it pretends to want to protect users from unauthorized intrusion by blocking us from our own files. It's as if I need to ask permission from Google before I leave the country.If anyone can tell me how to get around this (I could find no way to block my location), I would appreciate it. Otherwise, I'll have to ditch the Chromebook and return to traveling with a laptop. This is a criticism of Google, not Chromebook although it would be nice if Chromebook would provide a way to tell Google to butt out.

And I just have not encountered the issues I have regularly with Windows: updates that don't work or take forever to load, frozen screen, shut downs, you name it you know what I am talking about if you have ever owned a windows computer.Please note there is one drawback I have found and that is you need to have a cloud ready printer or else your regular printer must be connected to a mac or windows computer to be able to print.  Slightly inconvenient, but until I decide to buy a cloud ready printer, I'll just leave my old netbook hooked up to my printer for this purpose alone. I don't print a lot so not a big negative and there are workarounds, but it would be nice to just be able to hook up any printer.

518,"I love this.  I've never used Google Chrome before so there was a little bit of a learning curve.  This little lap top is perfect for me.  I travel a lot with my job and really all I need is something to get online with for personal use.  It's fast and easy to use.  It's so light that I can move it around easily.  In the last week, I've watched videos, tv shows, and surfed the internet with no issues.  The keyboard is easy to use and it's small size doesn't slow me down a bit.

519,"If you want something that displays Chrome and Chrome extensions, this laptop is perfect. It's small, has crazy battery life, has a matte finish screen (very little glare!), USB 2.0 *and* USB 3.0, Display Port (for external displays), and a Google-esque lower-case g symbol.My only complaint, which I am fairly sure is unique to the one I received, is that the bottom-right corner of the bezel can be opened up far too easily. It pops back in easily enough, it's just a weird thing that would drive some people crazy.

520,"Needed a light weight lap top to tote around to an internship.  Purchased this manufacturer refurbished.  Super happy with it.  Be sure to utilize the Chromebook guides and tutorials to familiarize yourself with its special features and mechanisms like hot keys, etc.  Its a very useful little machine if you're willing to work with chrome and google drive.

521,"It is light, very fast, cheap and highly functional. I was going to buy a new desktop, but opted for the Chromebook instead. Check out the reviews such as the one in liliputing.com. It is able to run an excellent office suite comparable to most of Microsoft Office either online or offline. I found, and it think most users will find, that the Chromebook will support more than 90% of one's computing needs. The only missing app I need is iTunes, and that is only to convert CDs. But once converted, songs can be stored and played on the Chromebook or loaded to an iPod or other device from the Chromebook.

522,"Everything I could have wanted in a chromebook.  Easy to use and that was good because no instructions manual came with it.  Since having the chromebook, the computer laptop is never turned on and can't really imagine why I'd use it again.  I'm excited about learning and using all the available apps.  The delivery of this item was somewhat annoying as I bought it for an Easter gift and ordered it ten days in advance and paid for expedited shipping, but the order was not processed for three days and then it arrived after Easter.  Other than that, very pleased with the purchase.

I am disappointed that the OS doesn't work with Netflix streaming yet, but they are ""working on it.""This cheap computer is great for those tech-less individuals who just need the basics.  The computer is extremely light-weight and great for travel.  But doesn't heat up like my old Macbook Air used to, one of the advertised features.  The keyboard is great and there are a few 'hidden' features that some may have trouble finding-- like the caps lock button is now a search feature.But for the money, it is a great machine that I truly enjoy using!

525,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my 11 and 13 year olds so they would have their own device to do their homework with, play Minecraft and video chat. Found that there are just too many things I want to do that are incompatible with the Chrome OS.First problem was getting the unit to wake up. When I first opened it, everything was fine and U took a tour if the device. I then closed the cover while leaving it plugged in to charge. When I came back and opened the cover, it would not come back on, though the power light was on. I tried shutting off, unplugging, holding power button for several seconds... Nothing.Called Samsung support, tech had me hold power button for 15 seconds. Power light finally went out, and then I was able to turn on again. Tech said it was a ""sleep bug"" in the Chrome OS that they were working on. A month later and I'm still having the same issue.Converting Woird docs to Google Docs was not difficult, but adds an extra step. My son was unable to log in to his purchased Minecraft account as the OS is incompatible.Wasn't able to make the Google plus video chat work so tried to set up Skype. It would not work with Chrome.Bought a new wireless printer to use with Chromebook. Did everything they said to do but I'm unable to print from Chromebook to the printer. I can print wirelessly to the printer with every other device in the house, including the iPhones and iPod touches, but not the Chromebook.Set up a 20 minute intro call with the Chromebook staff. They were only able to review the most basic things, unable to solve any of my problems.I like that everything is web-based, but it us simply too limited in so many basic things I and my kids need to do for me to recommend.

527,"If you are looking for a Chromebook, then you should know it isn't a full functioning laptop. It runs ChromeOS, which means any Windows or Mac apps likely won't be available. It is perfect if you want a machine to browse the web. That is about it. I am typing this from the Samsung Chromebook and love it. It is silent, never gets hot and has enough cloud storage for anything I do need. Not for everyone, but if it is for you it is an excellent Chromebook and pretty cheap too.

I also own a regular desktop computer, so it's easy to link this device so I can save all my documents to that hard drive and print off that printer. Because of the lack of hard drive and other components, this laptop performs excellently and with a superb battery life. You're able to watch full HD videos thanks to the stunning quality of the screen.All in all, for $250, you can't get a better laptop.

529,"I got this for my son for Christmas and he absolutely loves it. At $249.00 it is not at all expensive. I spent more than that on a hard drive for him not too many years ago. After a little less than a month he has portioned the hard drive and installed Linux on the other half, It's amazing how fast it dual boots with both operating systems on the built in SSD. He continues to rave about all the support that is available online from the original Google programmers and the rapidly growing customer base. I would highly recommend it to anyone that likes to play with one of the least expensive yet highly customizable hi-tech toys.

It runs a version of linux that chrome has modified and it's not bad.  I was able to pick it up and learn it in about 10 or 20 minutes but I could see that taking longer for less experienced computer people.2 - It's awesome how small and durable this machine feels.  Also, the keyboard is absolutely awesome.

531,"It's light, very quick and snappy, looks sleek, detailed and bright screen and durable. Very good laptop if you want to surf the web.  However, what it lacks is a good file management system, if you want to use the relatively small internal storage. So, if you want to use it to store, transfer or copy files, not very easy. (it's still possible) This is something, Google is mentioning too. It's a tool to mostly surf the web or use online applications and use cloud base storage. If that is all you want to do, go for it.

532,"I love my Samsung Chromebook.  But Beware!  My son-in-law, a software professional, told me to get the Samsung Chromebook and buy it re-furbished to save money.  The Chromebook came quickly in perfect condition.  But, what is not explained is it may not be upgraded to the newest software revision.  It WILL NOT automatically Upgrade even though it flashes a message that it does it automatically.  I realized I could not link to the needed apps and I was limited in its use.  I took it to my son-in-law.  He researched the blogs and discovered many Samsung Chromebooks did not include the latest software to allow the newest upgrade.  The upgrade is time consuming and a bit complicated and Samsung decided since the price is cheap, we can figure it out for ourselves.  My son-in-law had to  over-write and reboot the system,  Since he did it over home wi-fi it took about an hour and a half.  Once the upgrade was done, and my son-in-law gave me pointers on how to use functions, I have not put my Chromebook down.  I now have the Chromecast on my TV and did away with my cable company's on demand, just hulu, netflix, etc..  Cut my cable bill in half.  I would have never known what to do or how to do it.

I love the Chromebook in general so take my review in that light. I actually bought the Samsung 5 550 for my wife. I bought this Chromebook for my mom who is a novice computer user. The keyboard is a bit small for my hands. It has a tendency to delay a bit on some operations e.g. playing video. It lags a bit. I upgraded to the dev channel and GoogleDocs did not open I reset the machine and set it to the stable channel.  The problem was fixed. I was pleased to see how easy it is to recover itself.

536,"The negative reviews are clearly from users who have no idea what this ""LAPTOP"" is really supposed to be. This is NOT Microsoft Windows! It is BROWSER based, meaning everything mostly runs on Google's Chrome browser - hence, the operating system is called ChromeOS - it is not Windows or a MAC! If you already have a Google account, then once you login, all your bookmarks, calendar, settings will already be there. (It's kind of creepy, but it does make things more convenient)If you browse the web a lot - you will love this device! Tablets, especially smartphones, just aren't there yet to having a real nice smooth full web browsing experience. I do a lot of web browsing and writing reviews and it's an absolute joy owning this now; I use it way more than my tablet now.Tablets are good for watching video and apps, but for heavy web browsing - this Chromebook blows it away. (Syncing a Bluetooth keyboard with a tablet isn't always that convenient and you can sometimes feel the delay)Even if you already own a laptop, this is an excellent secondary laptop for browsing the web - you can have many tabs open and it's just a really nice clean browsing experience. And for the price, you really can't beat it! What a bargain.Pros:- Very fast boot-up and wakes up fast. I love it. (I usually don't even shut down the device; I just keep it closed and it wakes up right away with all my tabs/websites ready to go - very nice!)- Light (it's light and slim - very easy to carry and rest on your lap)- No annoying fan noise (from my past experience with laptops, the fan would get loud and hot just from simple browsing; I absolutely love being able to always browse quietly - No annoying hard drive spinning noises either.)- Does not get hot (it can get warm if you're watching videos, but it's nowhere near burning hot like it is with regular laptops; I love being able to type without my palms burning up resting it on the keyboard)- Excellent keyboard and touchpad (the keyboard feels and looks like it's from a Macbook; I'm typing this review on the keyboard now and it's a really nice typing experience! To scroll with the touchpad, you swipe with two fingers. To right click with the touchpad, you also push down with two fingers.)- Screen is matte finish, so there's no annoying screen glare. It's also very easy on the eyes, at dim settings, so it's nice browsing late at night.- Excellent battery life; I also love that it shows the remaining battery life in time and not just bars. When you're charging it, it's also nice that it shows the actual time remaining until it is fully charged.- Built-in speakers aren't anything extraordinary, but it's not bad. The speakers are located on the bottom.- Charger isn't an enormous brick either; it's pretty compact.- SD card reader, USB 3.0, and HDMI out --- WOW! I really can't believe all these premium useful extra features added for the price.- Price! Excellent. This is affordable and it's a must have for students!Cons:- Limited Bluetooth support for audio (it's nice that it even has Bluetooth, but it's limited for certain keyboards/mouse)- No app as of yet for Skype/Video chat. Microsoft unfortunately owns Skype.  You can still chat on Skype by using IM+ using the browser. Alternative to Skype is Google's version called Hangouts, which will allow you to video chat with more than one person at time.Who this laptop is for:- If your primary purpose is browsing the web and want a better experience. (Facebook, YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Video, etc.. This is perfect for using while laying in bed because it never gets burning hot, nor is there any loud fan getting involved -- and it's light! Just make sure you don't sleep on top of it. ;)- College students (light to carry and fast boot up and no fan noise, excellent keyboard, matte finish screen, good battery life, makes it ideal for classroom environment. This is running on ChromeOS, so you can't install Microsoft Word; however, you can still type documents and upload it using Google Drive and then do whatever you need to do later)- If you're looking for a light, secondary laptop ""to-go""; this is a great companion to any main PC/laptop.- Someone just starting out with computers (it's clean and simple... just being on the internet will be a whole new world to them, and they can enter it while having a nice keyboard and touchpad/perfect for having on your lap without being heavy/hot/noisy.I build my own computer, been using computers/internet for years, I am a gadget freak and there isn't a day I don't use them -- and I find the Chromebook to be definitely worthwhile.The top row of the keyboard has the quick shortcut keys:Back/Forward button, Refresh, Minimize, Switch Windows, Dim screen/brighten screen, Mute, Lower sound/Turn up sound, and then Power button.Since you'll mostly be browsing the web with a device like this, it's nice to have those forward/back/refresh buttons on the top.It would be nice if it had a home/end keyYou'll want to remember these hotkeys:Ctrl + Alt + Up Arrow = Home (also use this to scroll to the very top of the page quickly) or you can also press Search/Find key (the magnifying glass key, the key right above the Left Shift key) + Left ArrowCtrl + Alt + Down Arrow = End (also to scroll to the very bottom quickly) or Search key + Righ ArrowAlt + Arrow Up = to scroll upAlt + Arrow Down (or spacebar) = to scroll downAlt + Backspace = DeleteCtrl + W to close windows/tabsCtrl + Tab to switch tabs (Actually, I find a better way recently where you can use three fingers and swipe the mousepad left or right to actually select between different window tabs! Very nice!)Alt + Tab to switch windows (there is already a quick key for this on the top of the keyboard)Hold Ctrl and click on a link to open in a new tab.Hold Ctrl and Shift then click on a link to open a new tab and automatically switch to it for you.For Caps Lock, you press Alt + Search key (the search key is right above the left Shift key; or below the Tab key; or left of the letter 'a' key; it looks like a magnifying glass)You'll use those hotkeys often! Remember and use them and you'll have a great browsing experience.You can press Ctrl + Alt + ? to view the map of the keyboard.If you press Ctrl + Alt + Z you can toggle Spoken Feedback, which will read things out loud for you.To take screenshots, press Ctrl + Window Switch key (the 6th key from the left on the very top row; next to the dim settings key) And if you press Ctrl + Shift + Window Switch key, you can select a region to take the screenshots. It will be saved under your DownloadsYes, it has a plastic feel (that's why it's light... duh) and you'll want to be extra careful due to its build quality - obviously it's not built to be a tank - but what do you expect at this price and still get all the nice quality features? I rather have a usable nice keyboard and light weight/slim than a bulky metallic body that's just durable.Obviously, it's not perfect... but for what it is, it's pretty amazing. Being harsh and precise, it is a 4 star product, but I give it 5 stars because I really do love using this overall, and it has provided me a way better browsing experience than a tablet and my previous old laptops that cost me almost 4 times as much.You have to understand, though, this device will NOT replace a main PC/computer/laptop. It's just perfect for someone who simply wants to browse the web, check emails, write  and do simple tasks without all the heavy bulk, downtime, and accessories needed to type comfortably.I still plan on investing in a high-end laptop for video editing and other power hungry uses, but for web browsing and writing, this is a perfect tool and I plan on always using this to browse the web. It's also better to surf the web with this because you'll have less chances of obtaining a virus, compared to a PC (although you'll still need to be careful with phishing sites that try to steal your information.)Sorry for the lengthy review; I didn't think I would end up writing this much for this. I probably wouldn't have written this much if I was sitting on my computer -- and definitely NOT with a tablet. Again, I'm writing this review using the Chromebook and it was possible doing it comfortably. I think I will start writing a novel with the Chromebook.... I probably mentioned it a few times already, but I really love the soft mushy keyboard, screen/size, weight, battery life... I really wish I had something like this when I was still in college!Tip: Some pointless fun: When you're browsing, press Ctrl + Alt + Shift + Refresh button.

540,"Got the 3g version about a week ago, and love it so far. Lightweight, good battery life, good screen, ample/appropriate number of ports. The included data plan (100MB) works fine for me because, even though I have a 5GB hotspot as well, for email, web, and the like, 100MB is more than adequate for ordinary content consumption.Pros:Virtually no setup required beyond account info and network connectivity.Lightweight OS performs very well from a performance perspective.Activating the verizon service was painless and quick (quick phone call, setup the account, provide device number, done).If system is on Wifi, all traffic routes through it even if 3g is turned on (no wasted 3G)3G service shuts off at 100MB included cap, which prevents overages.Fair number of plugins and apps for the OS and browser.Quality display.Good keyboard and touchpad.3G service is great for what this device is intended.Deep integration with Google services.Browser support for Office365 is good; run MS Office on the Web if you don't like Google Apps, no need to install MS Office locally.SD Card slot for expansion.Near instant power on.Multiple account/user support.Can function as a hotspot.Fast recharge.Very lightweight.Cons:No audio support in bluetooth (huge shortcoming, requires a dongle)Single, combined 3.5mm jack for headphone & microphone (have to buy a dongle/adapter or new headset).SIM card slot, but apparently deactivated for US devicesInconsistent support for large flash apps (example, Harley's bike builder app), but still looking into this.Power brick is larger than expected.No netflix support yet (surprising)Tablet sized storage a (16GB; however, this is a cloud oriented device, so this isn't a big deal)All in all, a very good device if you're not interested in running MS Office locally (you can do that at Office365) and don't have a need for a bunch of specialized third party apps. Between the generally good hardware design and performance, the available web apps, hosted productivity solutions such as apps Google Apps and Office 365, and the growing third party apps & extensions, this is a fairly complete offering at a ridiculously low price.I'd much rather carry this than an underpowered e2-1800 AMD based netbook or i3/Pentium laptop weighing twice as much simply because they offer a big hard drive and more local app installation capability. This is a much better proposition for me, and it goes everywhere with me.

541,"I'm not going to go into great detail about the Samsung 11.6"" Chromebook in this review.  I've read many of the reviews and I can say that there are others that have covered this is great detail already.  But I'll throw in my viewpoint on a few items.  First, as most have indicated - This isn't a Windows PC, so if that is what you are looking to purchase (or replace), then most likely you'll find a few critical elements missing (oh, such as being able to install Windows Software) that will be a deal breaker.  It is absolutely critical that purchasers of this device understand what it is and what it isn't.So what is it?  I like to call it a Web Appliance, because that's where it excels.  It's a small computer with keyboard that gets you access to the Internet & Cloud based computing.  So can you only use it for Web browsing?  No, it can be much more than that if you are willing to move away from the Windows PC paradigm of computing and consider Apps, in particular Google Apps/Docs to do your work.  If you are, then this little machine can cover (almost all) web browsing needs, (light) word processing, presentation and spreadsheet work.  But you'll be using Google Docs for that effort which isn't MS Office, but for most work is sufficient.Another sweet spot for me is the simple fact that I have had it with Windows PC, as powerful and capable as they can be, they are optimal for about 6 months.. then the SW hogs takeover and within a year or two your machine is dreadfully slow and needs a full re-format and reinstall of Windows.  Then the cycle starts over.  BTW, I'm a PC guy - I've only ever had MS Windows PC and still figure I need at least one functioning Windows PC in the house.  I use Adobe products (Lightroom / Photoshop) and to do that I still need a full functioning Mac or PC.  So devices like the Chromebook don't fully replace those, but sure simplify keeping a family of 6 up and running with basic computing needs and internet access.  And moving to Cloud computing and document storage simplify data access and backup.Negatives:  I'm not concerned about things the chromebook never claimed to do.  But there are some features  that Chromebooks claim to do that they either don't do or don't do well.  First - Printing.  There is no easy way to print to (most) existing home printers.  You can set it up to use Google Cloud print - it does work, but not without it's share of  hassles.  I do use it that way, but then I have to go to my full featured PC and log into my Google Account.  Then it works seamlessly.  But if your PC is in sleep mode or off, no go.  The print job is queued.  (The exception to this is if you have a true cloud enabled printer, then you can print directly.  But for most of us that means buying a new printer as our existing printers won't have that capability.)  SECOND:  Streaming, such as Netflix.  On the particular Chromebook device I purchased, Netflix is not supported.  This seems to be a big miss by Google.  They are working on it and I'm guessing it will get there, but Streaming is the future of media delivery and Chromebooks need to support it as much as possible.  Streaming is a Cloud feature, right?  THIRD:  Keyboard/Mouse - Awesome keyboard physically, but there is a bit of a learning curve on a few items if you've only ever used MAC/PC solutions.  But I'll give Google/Chrome credit - if people learn how to use both the onscreen keyboard help or the online help system, help is very much available.  You just have to be a bit patient to learn the system.We've had our Chromebook just for over a month.  That's far too short a time period to make any claims as to it's stability or longevity.  But our experience in my family has been positive so far.  It's working for what I purchased it for.  It's small, light, great battery life and works (almost) instantly on startup which means it's great for a quick glace at that email that has that address that you need as you run out the door.  If you're looking for that extra device to get on the web, do email, facebook, some light word processing, then I do think Chromebook is a great solution.

542,"I will start by saying that I have two desktop PCs that I use for the heavy duty stuff, but I've always had a laptop for mostly web browsing and chatting with friends.  I previously had a Macbook Air that recently died a bit prematurely, so I thought I would give this Chromebook a shot.Firstly, I really like the size of the laptop.  It's very small and lightweight, and yet the keyboard and trackpad feel really good.  I am very picky about my laptop trackpads, having been spoiled by my Air.  Most Windows laptops have horrible trackpads and I was very concerned about going to this one.  However, the accuracy is excellent and the gestures are pretty good.  I don't think they are quite up to par with the Macs, but for this price point the trackpad is better than Windows laptops that are three times this price.As far as the operating system itself, color me impressed.  I was a user of Google Chrome already and heavily invested into Google web apps, so that transition wasn't hard at all.  I did find myself looking for some viable Chrome-based alternatives to software that I used on my PC, like a VNC client.  To date, I haven't found a single piece of software that I need on a daily basis on a laptop that doesn't have a Chrome app for it.The only negative thing I can say is that the ARM processor in this guy can sometimes get a little sluggish on graphically intensive pages, but mostly it's smooth.  High definition video is just fine most of the time, but some pages can still slow it down to a crawl.  I have tweaked a couple of settings and blocked some web elements from loading and that seemed to improve it greatly.  I definitely recommend this Samsung Chromebook and Chrombooks in general.  I will probably grab another one when the Haswell updates come out.

543,"This is the perfect ultraportable laptop on the market. I bought it as sort of a secondary laptop; something that could do basic word processing, internet browsing, video-playing, etc. This laptop not only met my expectations, it exceeded them. This laptop quickly became my ""go to"" laptop, while my ""real"" laptop only gets taken out for specific purposes (when I need to play a CD or run Windows-only software). The laptop is very quick thanks to its flash only memory and lightweight OS and while some buyers may be concerned about its lack of a ""real"" processor, it has not hiccuped in my every day use at all. The laptop is very aesthetically pleasing and takes many design cues from Apple's Macbook Air. It is very sturdy and feels ""dense and significant"" despite its  extremely light weight.The only drawback I've found so far is that in stead of a Caps-Lock button, there is a ""search"" button. This is particularly a problem for me because I am one of the (apparently) few people who use the Caps-Lock instead of the shift button. However, it is  especially a problem because the search button interrupts my typing when I forget to use the shift key. In fact, I've done it several times during this review. This may not be a problem for most people, but its worth pointing out in case anyone is like me.All in all, this is a great device. When I purchased it, I was concerned that I would find the relatively stripped functionality to be a problem, but its been a great laptop that I look forward to using for a long time.

544,"I use the Chromebook all the time at home, and when I am looking to surf the web or do relatively light computing. It has an amazing battery life, and the need to be connected to WiFi isn't that big a deal - there are hot spots nearly everywhere you go, and I also have a mobile WiFi hot spot from my phone provider. While limited apps and lack of internal storage and a thin OS limits the usefulness of the Chromebook, the use of the cloud computing resources from Google, coupled with the very low cost, makes this a good value and worth picking up as a second machine.

545,"I know competitors are knocking it but I bought this for Christmas for my wife. She is not all the computer savy and this fits the bill for her. She does a lot of online research for recipes, art tips and instruction, gardening, anything. It works very well, it is simple and pretty user friendly. I think its a great deal. Because it doesn't have windows doesn't mean you can't use spread sheets or word processing software, Google Docs is just find for those purposes. She uses it every day.

546,"I bought the Chromebook last month as I wanted a machine at home for surfing the web on and didn't want to splash out for a Macbook Air. I own quite a lot of devices, but despite having a keyboard for my ipad mini, I wanted a chromebook.The Chromebook is fast to boot and very light; it's lighter than my work Macbook Air and battery life is decent. For me the Chromebook does everything I wanted:Allows me to browse the webHas a decent batteryBoots quicklyDoesn't crash (it's not Windows!)So why no 5* ??? Well this is definitely good value for money, there's no arguing with that. The OS boots quick, but the browsing experience and rendering of pages is a little slower than on my Mac and I do notice it. The other reason is that the material is very cheap and does mark easily.Despite all of that I would recommend this if you want to a cheap device to surf the web on.

He wants to be able to check his e-mail, pay his bills, do some online shopping, and things of that nature. He absolutely loves it.

I love that I can just hook it up to a monitor with an HDMI cable and use my beg screen. Has a built in bluetooth (haven't had a chance to use it yet). Wifi range is good. Bedroom and router have 3 walls between them and there is no lag. Battery life is about 6 hours on average with web browsing and youtube videos. Big mouse bad and raised keyboard are easy to use. Shortcuts at the top make moving faster. Best investment I've made so far this year.

I love how light and small it is for taking notes or surfing the web, but I often find myself borrowing other computers for presentations at work because I don't have the right output or it can't read/display the slideshow file properly. It does what it does well, and I was really happy to have it after my last laptop was...misappropriated, but it isn't a substitute for a computer. Make sure you do your research before buying.

554,"OK I have been using Windows computers and laptops for years, but I was on a much tighter budget this time, so I thought I would give this a try.  I wanted to wait a few days before I wrote a review so I could give an honest opinion.  I mainly just needed something for internet use and this definately delivers.  I use it at home where I have wifi and it performs exceptionally.GOOD SIDE: SUPERFAST startup/shut down.SUPERFAST wifi connectionBattery last a long time.  I charge it in the morning and get 7 or more hours out of a charge before I have to plug it in.Internet works flawless.Video quality isnt AWSOME but it is pretty good.The bottom gets warm, but not hot at allKeyboard is slightly different from a standard keyboard, but works well.BAD SIDE:If you close the lid, it goes to sleep and looses internet.  Currently there is no way to disable this, but from what I have read in the forums, it is being worked on.There are a few things missing from the keyboard that you are used to having on a regular keyboard, so learning the shortcuts can be time consuming, but not really a big issueThe touchpad gets a little getting used to.  Remember, this is not a windows computer, so expect a learning curve.So far after a week of using the Samsung Chromebook, I don't have any real complaints.  For what I use it for it works fantastic.  If you are looking for a high performance laptop, this is not for you.  If you are a gamer, this is not for you.  If you surf the web all day and spend alot of time on social media, this IS FOR YOU.Please keep in mind THIS IS NOT WINDOWS.  There will be a learning curve to using this.  Once you get the hang of it, it is great.  So Far I LOVE IT!!!UPDATE:I have been using this for about 2 weeks now as my main computer and so far it still works fantastic.  The battery is amazing.  I charge it at night and it lasts pretty much most of the day.  Its lightweight so it travels so easy between rooms.  As I have seen on  many other reviews, it does loose its internet connection when you close the lid, but once you open it up it only takes about 5-6 seconds to reconnect to wifi.  So far there are very few things that I can't do on here that I could do with a regular laptop, but so far it has been worth every penny.

555,"We have a Samsung Chromebook at my place of work, and I tried it out.  I loved it, so I ordered one of my own. It's wonderful. Easy to use, great keyboard, fast. It was perfect for my needs. I couldn't find anything I didn't like about it. . . EXCEPT it wouldn't hold the wifi connection at home. I could use it for 10-15 minutes and then it would lose the connection and just try over and over to reconnect. When it did finally reconnect, it would be for only a few seconds or minutes. I visited the most popular Chromebook users groups and found that this is a common problem. The Chromebook doeesn't hold the signals from some routers, apparently.  It gets a little murky about exactly what causes it. There were all sorts of suggestions about how to handle the problem--reset this, disable that, get closer to the router, etc.--but I'm not tech savvy, and no one could say what the solution definitely was. I called Cisco, the maker of the router I own, to get help with some of the suggestions and perhaps get to the root of the problem. They would have been happy to help me for the low, low price of $200. I tried two other Samsung Chromebooks at home without success, so I believe it is something to do with my network. I decided to return the Chromebook. I will be among the first in line when I hear that the Chromebook works out of the box with all wifi networks, or if I can get reliable information about which reasonably priced router it definitely works with.Only 4 stars because it's a wifi device that doesn't work on some wifi networks.

I already have a Galaxy tab 10.1, which I love, but also wanted a laptop that was light-weight, very portable, but had a physical keyboard/mousepad for some of my tasks.

559,"I bought two of these for my kids aged 8 and 10 so they could play Flash games without taking my MacBook Pro. The older child has also started using Google Drive apps for school reports and presentations as well. One obvious shortcoming I discovered when setting up their accounts is that Google requires that users be 13 years old to get an account so I had to set myself up as admin on each of their devices and then use my birthday when setting up their individual accounts in order to get the free cloud storage for each device (since the free storage is one per account, they had to be the registered users). Google's commercials seemed to advertise a laptop for everyone (including kids) so I'm not sure how I was ""supposed"" to resolve the issue other than lying about their age (and accepting responsibility for monitoring their internet usage). The Chromebooks are plastic and not as solid as a unibody MBP, as you might expect - picking one up by the front corner while it is open results in the touchpad engaging (due to flex), and some of the keys often get stuck down, but other than these minor faults they are great devices with impressive battery life.

560,"I received this a day back and am overall satisfied. Could have been better but I accept the product with its limitations and still see inherent value in its price point in recommending it, albeit to a different audience.First of all I had high hopes for this, I am tired of the Windows and Apple monopolies on OSes, I wanted something light, completely connected to the web as most of my needs are web based, hence the Chromebook.Likes: Ease of use, the thing is a little tiger, just trying and trying to provide you with different Use Cases for it.The keyboard though small, is ample to type on within 20 mins I was back to Windows level speed.The new keys are actually an improvement over regular Fn keys, I use them way more.Build quality is decent, I did notice that the screen can bend when pressure is applied, but the screen itself is nice and crisp.Music and video play well, there are native apps for them, pretty neat out of the box.Whole presentation is clear, and clean I like it.The laptop worked with my keyboard/mouse combo through USB but I didnt like not using the new keys so reverted back to the laptop keyboard.Free 100gb from Google, Im a cloud person, and have transferred all my documents to Google Drive and Skydrive, so this works seamlessly for me. Love it.ConsI was really hoping this would be a primary computer replacement, alas I doubt it:1) I cant connect to my monitor, I purchased a HDMI to DVI adapter and there is no output.Major annoyance(I know Google is working on a fix though, along with extended desktop)2) Citrix receiver doesnt work properly and the .ica files can't open, big annoyance.3) If it doesnt work on my current monitor I doubt it would work on the Apple display I planned on purchasing.Otherwise it's great, Im planning on buying 1 more for generic use around the house.If I find answers to my Con list i'll update the review, or if someone has answers please reply.Update1: I checked the HDMI output to a TV and another Monitor and it worked pretty well, so im guess it's a problem with my monitor. A friend told me that extended desktop support is coming really soon. Also using HDMI to Display Port you can view the output on an Apple Display i cant confirm this though.

561,"Really enjoying this device. Worth the extra cost for the extended battery life. Recharges quickly, boots quickly, connects and loads internet fast, does everything fast! Set up is a breeze, its just your google account for the user log in. Easy to have multiple users on same device.You can't install normal programs, only Google Chrome apps. This was excellent for just internet, email, and your basic office programs.Some plugins can't work on Chromebook - like Silverlight (there's a special chromebook app to run Netflix just because of this) because you can't download and install them. However, there is a ton of support for Chrome browser, so I've hardly missed any of them.Things I didn't like:- Trackpad gestures are different and takes some getting used to. I still forget the gestures it teaches you when you first use it. Otherwise, is a very responsive multi-touch trackpad with a good texture feel.- No capslock button. Seriously bugs me, I use CAPs a lot for certain documents. Instead there's a button there that launches a search function? Ugggggnh I hate it.- Chiclet keyboard with odd/uncomfortable spacing on an already small device. Touch typers if you're like me, this keyboard is going to drive you nuts. Hunt-and-peck folks, you'll be just fine.In all, would be a great device for a student, a casual internet user, someone who wants a lightweight and fast device, and I'd also recommend it for introducing a new person to computers and the internet because its a simple interface with nothing to mess up.

562,"I bought this for my disabled sister who lives with me.  The Chromebook looked good to replace my old iBook which she used for email and looking at photos from her son who lives across country.  However the iBook had no camera, and she will shortly be a grandmother, so ""perfect, this has a web cam"" and she can do video conferencing.  I have a Samsung Galaxy 10.1 tablet, like it and it does web conferencing so this seemed to be a great solution.The first Chromebook that was shipped was horrible.  The net speed was terrible (.2 MB/S download) and a search on the internet showed that this was a systemic problem.  However after more research including a lot of Speedtest sessions, it was clear this one had a hardware problem, and Amazon exchanged it overnight.  The new one works just fine for what we intended it to do.The Pros are:- Price is definitely good.  Even my Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 cost more.- Size and weight is perfect.I might just buy another for traveling and leave my Viao at home.- Keyboard has nice sized keys that are well marked.  Very nice for a senior.- Graphics quality is very good for something so small.  The screen is nice and bright- Apps - they are just what you need though more on that later- Performance.  Even though it's a slightly slower processor, there is a GPU that takes off some of the load- Tweaks.  You can use quite a few tweeks to Chrome if you do some research in the forums.- Dual Band WiFi - nice to have it on a 5.6Ghz channel then the crowded 2.4Ghz- Battery Life seems to be really good, about 10 hours more or less- WebCam resolution and response are very goodThe Cons are:- It's not windows (and this seems to be a lot of complaints, though not mine)- The Wifi range isn't great - I have a 3000 ft/sq ranch and it can't go to the side opposite the house to the router.  I had to install a second wireless gateway in her room - no biggie but not expected.- Power management.  Its good, but if you put it to sleep it doesn't give you any alerts because it turns off the WiFi connection and can't get calls.  There is an app that will let you work around this however.- Keyboard (minor).  I think this is also a ChromeOS problem, but to do things like cap's lock you have to remember a keyboard shortcut.- Google's ChromeOS (generally - see my comments)- No Skype.  Most business folks won't appreciate this omission.- No printing without Cloudprint (which I don't like, I shouldn't have to go to the outside of my workgroup to print.)ChromeOS seems to me to be quite immature compared to Android, and I wonder if the two teams at Google ever talk to each other.  While Android (4.04) on my Galaxy is polished and sleek, ChromeOS feels clunky and reminds me of a mashup between Mac OSX (which I think was 10.0) and Windows 95. Except there is no concept of shortcuts that you can put on the desktop.  It took a while for Android to improve, and hopefully ChromeOS will too. Or maybe it will be replaced with Android.  If not, my understanding is I can have options to hack in any one of three different linux distributions.Other notes on Apps:Mail - nice and familiar GMail client.Video Conferencing - not good at all.  It relies on Google Hangouts which no one likes (sorry google - GMail Talk was better)  Skype is easy to use and Hangouts are not.  It's really that simple.Office Apps - light but nice for most users.  MS Office is far too bloated now IMHOSUMMARY:  On the whole, if you are on a budget and  want a light weight, compact netbook with good video and ergonomics, this is the one to buy.  If you are a poweruser with a need for speed, you should probably consider paying more for a top end Chromebook or a machine from Apple or running Windows.

WHAT I DO LIKE:  The operating system is always current and being updated from behind the scenes. It's the lightest laptop I've ever used.  The battery is fantastic.  The keyboard layout has been great.  The ability to turn it on and it's just ready to go is awesome.  Surfing the web, checking email, looking at FB no problems.  WHAT I HAVEN'T LIKED: Straight out of the box the Chromebook it would just reboot.  I read that this is because of a Chrome OS update.  There's no explanation as to what is happening it just shuts down and comes back on. It sounds bad but because it only takes about 20 seconds total for this to occur it really wasn't too much of a problem.  Heck, a reboot on my PC takes a couple of minutes not 20 seconds. Then came problems with playing videos.  Sometimes it's great and them sometimes I get messages that Shockwave has crashed or I need a new release of Flash Player.  In both situations you have to go to settings, clear out your cache, reboot and your good to go.  It's gotten to be a constant problem so much so that I wouldn't recommend it.  I'm trying to work with Google support but time is running out and I'm considering returning the Chromebook for a refund.

I also use the free RDP software available in the Chrome store to remote desktop into Windows 7 PCs- which works flawlessly, or use a free VNC viewer to remote into my home PC running Ubuntu.  Netflix runs great on the Chromebook, as does Hulu.  There is even a shell program built into the Chromebook that can be executed.

If you want to play off the shelf, CD or DVD games- this is DEFINETELY not the PC for you- the Chromebook is not a hard core game machine and WILL NOT play Windows based games.

565,"I bought this chromebook to use at school in early 2013. It served me well while it lasted (it just kicked the bucket).When I first got it, I was stunned. The computer was so inexpensive but fast and functional! It has a sleek design. Feels a bit cheap and plastic-y at times, but usually it functions well. The display isn't too amazing. The keyboard is very nice, spaced out, and easy to use. Some keys are missing such as caps lock, delete, etc. They are replaced with keys which function to control the web browsing experience, which are useful. The touchpad is functional and responds to two finger scrolling and other ""flick"" functions, which is very nice. However, I accidentally scratched it and the cheap material came off. This has also happened in other places around the laptop. It's pretty beat up. I had a case on it for a long time and still got scratches and dents and dings.When I first bought the machine, netflix did not work. However, a month passed and it became functional. Chrome OS is great because of the constant updates to improve performance.However, sometimes these updates come at a cost. After a lot of updates, the computer got gruesomely slow. Pages would not load. What once took 1 second to boot up took 10. I powerwashed the machine a couple weeks ago and the performance improved slightly.I used the laptop daily. It fit my needs. I do EVERYTHING on google docs. It runs youtube and spotify well, along with twitter and facebook. Tumblr has some issues because it is very image and video heavy, but it is okay for the most part.In the end, you get what you pay for. Apparently after a while of plugging the charger in and out, it runs down. My laptop had completely stopped taking a charge. I can wiggle the plug around and sometimes get the charger to light up. However, I can't complain. It got me through half of high school with mostly great performance. I am looking to get another chromebook, probably the Toshiba 2.**Also, here's a tip. NEVER TRUST ""Saved Offline""!!! I took my notes for a midterm in google keep, closed the tab after it assured me the changes were saved offline, and my notes were gone! Google docs is better offline most of the time, but it is a pain to set up without an initial internet connection.**

Yeah, tell me about it.  Anyhow, I went on my kindle and did A LOT of research for a good reliable without all the bells and whistles.  I just needed it simple for writing, emails, and photos,  I don't play music and games.  Nothing fancy shmancy and fast especially when I'm looking for a job!  I needed my resumes fast!  This one had the highest rating and a lot of reviews were great and to my surprise, the price was extremely reasonable especially when I'm a budget after moving clear across the U. S.

The only thing I'm missing because I'm so used to keyboarding is the number pad but it's not the end of the world.  I'm in not the office or working with numbers.  The keypad is very comfortable using right off the bat.  The pressure is just right.  It's easy to navigate.  This notebook is just the size of a notebook,  Very slender, sleek and light weight.

While I do wish it had more than one standard USB port, the webcam isn't the greatest and of all things, I sometimes miss the delete key but overall, I really like this computer. I use it a lot, take it everywhere and have rarely had any trouble with it and what trouble I've had has never been anything that couldn't be solved by closing some tabs or, at the most, restarting it. It has no problem picking up wi-fi signals most anywhere I am and that's been really helpful, much more so than trying to work on my phone.It's incredibly light and compact. As others have said because it has a solid state hard drive, there's no fan, so it's also incredibly quiet and while it does get warm during extended use, even if I'm using it all day, it never gets as hot as previous laptops did after even short periods of use. It keeps my lap about as warm as the average house cat, as opposed to burning my legs after twenty minutes.I frequently watch Netflix on my Chromebook. It keeps up, even if I have other tabs open. Usually, if anything goes wrong, it's Netflix and not the Chromebook. I've notice YouTube will occasionally get glitchy if I try to multitask while watching a video. The same can be said of Bandcamp but as far as streaming music from my Google Drive while typing or doing research, it usually works without any trouble. That said, the cloud storage aspect took some getting used to. I've learned to use the Scratchpad (Chrome OS equivalent of WordPad in Windows) rather than Google Docs to get my ideas out, so that I can access stuff even if I don't have internet and then when things are closer to being finalized, I use Docs to format everything and do my final drafts. With Sync, it uploads my Scratchpad files to my drive, so I can access them from my phone and other computers, as well.The app system is pretty good. I've yet to pay for an app and I have been able to find most anything I could need and install it quickly. There are lots of similar apps, so sometimes it's a matter of trying two or three and seeing which suits my needs. Some run internally, others open in the browser and connect online. Some of the latter can take awhile to load. It's not dissimilar to Android in that way. For all I know about computers and smartphones, it could be exactly the same.If anyone has any questions, I'd be happy to do my best to answer them. I really want to thank everyone who reviewed their Chromebook here because I read so many reviews before I decide to buy one and they really helped me make up my mind. I'm very glad I purchased this.

569,"I am currently a student at a University and this is the perfect computer for me. I already have a HP Envy 14 which I have used most of the year because I have not had my desktop, and although a great computer, is way too heavy and large for my uses. I just recently found out about this Chromebook and after watching a few reviews, I bought one used for $170.It is seriously the best $170 I have ever spent.Pros: This computer is incredibly fast due to its SSD and I love it. It will start up in seconds and wake up from hibernating in even fewer seconds. The matte screen is perfect as it gets surprisingly bright and due to its matte finish, is one of the best computers I have used outdoors or in window light ever. The brightness auto adjusts as well which is an awesome feature. The battery life is really amazing as I have never had an electronic that lasts as long as this one does. The keyboard feels smooth and the keys press very nicely. The hot keys on the top are convenient and although I don't use them all, the brightness and volume ones are used frequently every day. The computer weighs next to nothing and is also really thin, Although the computer is made of plastic and would be much better if it was aluminum,holds together just fine. The headphone jack is located on the left side of the computer towards the back and I have found this spot to be incredibly convenient.Cons (more so my dis-likings about the Chromebook): One thing that people need to know is that without Ubuntu installed on this laptop, it cannot run things offline very well. You can access Google Docs offline, but you can't necessarily run programs. When ever you open a music player or something, it opens up into a window. This computer only runs a browser,and that is it. Don't expect to be able to install Microsoft word on this computer or any other program without dual booting Ubuntu. The trackpad clicks easier towards the bottom when compared to the top, and I wish that it had the same amount of pressure needed at the top as well as the bottom. On the back of the computer the hinge sticks our which makes the computer excessively larger towards the end - I feel like this computer would look so much more sleek with it built in rather than being on the outside. Occasionally when I run a YouTube video and leave it to go to another tab, the video will begin to skip but this is not really that big of a problem.One thing I would advise people to do to take complete advantage of this computer would be to look into installing Ubuntu onto it so you can run Microsoft Word-like programs, photo software, etc. When I press 4 keys down, my Chromebook switches to Ubuntu and I am able to use this Chomebook as if it were are full fledged laptop. Because (most) everything on this computer is saved to Google Drive, if you mess up while installing Ubuntu you can just factory reset the laptop and everything is back to normal.Regardless of installing Ubuntu on here or not, I would advise everyone who wants to buy this computer and use it for internet and papers/spreadsheets/etc to BUY IT. It is fast, light, flawless, and beautiful. In today's age, WiFi is everywhere and chances are you spend a lot of your time on the computer browsing the internet. For $800 less than a Macbook Air you can get everything that it has (will Ubuntu installed) on a laptop that is almost as beautiful as a Macbook AIr. I would be happy to buy another one and will continually recommend this Laptop to people.If you have WiFi, mainly use your computer for internet browsing and working on papers/spreadsheets/etc, buy this computer. With and install of Ubuntu, you can have Photo editing software as well as many other programs such as a Microsoft-Word-mimic (Libre Office). I would advise this computer to many people, it is capabilities and quality of build/parts are unbeatable for its price.

571,"I bought this for the simplicity and great price.  Use it primarily for surfing and email and works just fine so far.  Much faster than my desktop, instant on.  Don't have to buy virus protection and haven't missed Windows, can open and send Word and Excel if needed.  Can print through regular printer on your network as well as wireless printers. Handy size to carry around but would like a larger version as well.  I have a tablet but hated not having a real keyboard and this is much easier to use than a touch screen.
            "
572,"This is lightweight, fast and for the price a great deal. The construction looks nice but does feel somewhat cheap, due to the plastic, but that is not a negative; the plastic keeps it light and probably allows for the low price. One significant problem that I have run into, however, is that almost every time I shut the lid or stop using it for a few minutes, it hangs and will not wake up without me having to reboot. I'm not sure if this is a software glitch or a hardware issue, so I may have to return it. Also, it's not clear whether or not USB optical drives can be used with it.

573,"I'm using a Chromebook as a supplemental computer for writing and heavy web browsing, and it's an incredible deal for the price. Most others have explained the Chrome OS well, and the limitations of such. I accepted them when I decided to buy it, but I wasn't expecting how high quality it was.It's literally a $250 11"" macbook air in terms of style. The build quality is very good, with large keys, a responsive trackpad, and a decent screen. If you are used to netbooks and low-end laptops like I am, you'll really be surprised at how solid it feels. The screen is very crisp for text, although the viewing angles are slightly odd. Rather than too dark, it seems too washed out at sub-optimal angles. For the price though this is one solid piece of gear.What's also surprising is how fast and responsive it feels. It awakens instantly from sleep, and boots from powerdown to log-in in about six seconds. Tabs open quickly, and saving JPEGS to the SSD literally was instant. While watching full screen video from Hulu worked well, with no stuttering, the display felt only average, with slightly washed out colors and muddy edges.The power brick is tiny, and from initial power on to use took all of five minutes. It really doesn't feel like something that is based on a tablet chip, and if you are okay with not being able to use dedicated programs, it works very well. It's possible to use the web for a tremendous amount of things, like basic photo and video editing, as well as lite productivity software through Google Docs.The only downsides I have had is that there are no buttons on the trackpad. While right clicking is absurdly easy (just click with two fingers slightly spread apart instead of one) selecting large blocks of text is a little less so. I also had one game's sound not work well, and saving to Google drive didn't work on one photo app; instead, I had to save locally. Considering how many benefits counterbalance this, I can give it five stars easily.This is probably the perfect computer to give to a senior; it just works at what it does, has no security issues and is far better built than the price would suggest. It's also an ideal computer if you want something portable do to light work on; small, good battery life, and nimble enough to do work on. Some issues you would think aren't even any. Yes, without an internet connection it's useless, but your average laptop or home computer is almost never without it, and the internet makes up a majority of the average user's use. You can't do Netflix on this one, due to the CPU, but given its poor streaming library, I don't miss it.I recommend it, and I'm really loving it now. It's nice to be surprised above your expectations for a product, and this one does so.
            "
574,"Perfect for a college student. It's super light and small and I basically bring it with me everywhere. You need wifi to do anything really but I never have a problem with that (because there's wifi at my apartment and on-campus - the only places I really use my lap top). It took me a while to get used to having Google only stuff, like Google Docs instead of Microsoft Word and such; but I've found I don't really mind it at all - it's all the same to me.Cons:- The top gets scratched easily so I recommend buying a case for it.- No CD drive- only 1 USB drive- you can't really download stuff...especially software for other programs

575,"I bought this for my electric engineer guy friend, not young by any means, so as not to mistake ""likeing this very much"" with stars in his eyes. He always said he didn't ""like or need anything like that"" ie: Ipad or Tablet, ect. However, I read one review by another enginner and thankfully took the advice and bought one.  As soon as he opened it he was sure he wouldn't like it.  I told him not to worry it (Samsung Chromebook) can be sent back after the holidays. In less time than that he was using it often, to read his alternate news journelists, main stream news, quick research, and more. Everything he use to do with his phone or at work.  I can only say if a very picky man (he'd shutter at the adjective) likes the Chromebook as much as he, it HAS TO BE GREAT.  Thank you to that other enginner, and Samsung, of course, for making this gift a good pick!

576,"This is my second chromebook, I own one of the original CR-48 beta chromebooks, I'll never buy another windows computer again and certainly wouldn't consider an overpriced underfeatured mac. The samsung so far has been an excellent piece of hardware and the chrome operating system combined with wifi/3g internet access allows me to take it almost anywhere. It does everything that 95% of computer users need. It starts up extremely quickly, I do what I need to do, and then shut it down all before my windows pc is ready to do anything. Also no anri-viral software necessary. I'm surprised more people aren't using these.
            "
577,"This device is a tweener, and when evaluated as such, I love it.  I'm using it even more often than I thought I would.  I have a high end desktop with a linux OS, a Dell laptop with Win7, a Nexus 7 and this Chromebook.  So far, the Chromebook is getting the most use.  The form factor, long battery life, full-fledged browser, and instant on make this device more compelling than the others.  I had considered buying a MacBook Air to use as a ""couch computer"" but this one does the job for a quarter of the price.  Note that I didn't say it does everything the Air does, because it doesn't, but it does all the things I was going to do with the Air.I think it's better to compare this Chromebook to mobile devices rather than to a full-fledged laptop, even though I'm using it more like a laptop.  That opinion may change over time as more HTML5 capabilities are utilized on the net, but even as a mobile device, this beats every tablet out there.  It has a nice keyboard, a very nice trackpad, full-fledged applications (I'm so sick of truncated browsers and email apps on Android and IOS), and a large screen that's much better than I expected, given some of the feedback I've read.One other plus - the 100GB of space on Google Drive for two years is worth almost half the asking price of this little machine.The only downside I see to this is the limited capability of web apps.  Like I said before, that may change, but until then, I don't think I could live with this being my only computer.  I need vector and bitmap drawing programs, sound editing, desktop publishing, etc.  These are robust apps and while they do have web based counterparts, that functionality is limited by bandwidth and feature sets.Over all, I'm VERY happy with my new Chromebook, and I'm looking forward to the changes that will be coming for Chrome OS in the future.

578,"I love the Google Chromebook because it gives you the full computer lap top experience without you having to wait three minutes to reboot. It takes less than 10 seconds to reboot plus you can connect a printer to it but I have not tried that yet. Another good thing about the Chromebook is that it never needs anti-virus software because it has that protection built in. With Chromebook you get Apple quality without the punishing high price. I recommend this product for everyone such as businesses, schools, and just for personal use.
            "
579,"I love my new Samsung Chromebook. After one week of constant use, I am very pleased with my purchase. I would like to begin by saying that my ""main"" computer is a 15.5"" Sony Vaio that dual-boots Ubuntu and LinuxMint. I am a student and was looking for something that would be a more portable as I run back and forth from home to university. I browsed the latest laptops at Best Buy and was not ready to commit to funding any of the new models I saw. Then, I came across the Chromebook section and decided $249 was a perfect price and it appeared that the machine had all the basic requirements I would need. To my great disappointment, Best Buy was sold out so I immediately came home and ordered one from amazon.Who Should Buy a Chromebook?Anyone who wants a more portable laptop and only needs a computer for writing documents, browsing the web or watching videos should really consider a Chromebook. Also, any first-time laptop owners who just want to do simple tasks would benefit from having a Chromebook because they are so easy to use and you do not have to worry about licences, updates or viruses. If you need specific software or play a lot of games, the Chromebook would not be a good replacement.What I Like:Set-up - Setting up a Chromebook is the easiest set up I have every gone through. If you have a google account, all you do is login using that information, select your wi-fi network and time zone and everything is ready for you. If you use the Chrome web browser, all of your tabs are synced.Size - 11.6"" seems so small compared to my 15.5"" laptop, but the Chromebook's size makes it easily portable. The screen size has only been an issue on a few select website where I needed to adjust the page view, but otherwise I feel I adjusted very well to the smaller size.Keyboard - The Chromebook's keyboard is one of its best features. I love typing on this little machine. The size of the keys and the space between the keys is perfect. Instead of function keys above the numbers, the Chromebook has smart keys to better navigate the Chrome browser. Also, screen and volume adjustment keys are in this same row, making controlling your machine a lot easier than trying to remember which function key does what. There is no page up or down keys, but a series of keyboard shortcuts found on the Chromebook's website will show you how to achieve those tasks.Trackpad - I love the larger trackpad, so much more intuitive and useful than the standard PC trackpads. I have noticed this style is catching on in other PC brands (thanks Apple).Solid State Drive - One of the main reasons I chose the Samsung Chromebook over the Acer Chromebook, other than aesthetics, was the SSD. Although only 16GB, with Google Drive's 100GB cloud storage, I have plenty of room for my files and pictures. When I am using the Chromebook, several tabs open and typing away, I am still surprised how the machine makes NO noise. The casing never gets hot, I have noticed it becomes warm while in use, but that is to be expected and is not a distraction. The fast and soundless SSD leads me to my following point . . .Battery Life - This is the best feature of the Chromebook. I have clocked in over 6 hours of battery life before charging. I have yet to run the battery down lower than 25% because I never need to! The simplicity of the operating system (Chrome OS) and the fact that the traditional hard drive with moving parts has been replaced by a flash drive absolutely contributes to the Chromebook's lasting battery life. Of course, when I am on batter power, I turn the brightness down. I no longer even bother bringing the power cord with me to school since I can get plenty of work done between charges.Things I'm Getting Used To . . .I was an early adopter to the Chrome web browser because it was always the fastest on the operating systems I used. With that said, I would consider myself very familiar with how to use the Chrome features. However, using Chrome OS was an adjustment for me, because it was different than what I was used to. Not worse or harder, just different. I had to get used to using Google Drive instead of Dropbox and using Google Docs instead of LibreOffice or MS Word. Also, I still have my other laptop that I needed to figure out how to sync with my new Chromebook to make switching between machines seamless. After a few days, I was able to figure out a system that worked for me.Also, the Chromebook doesn't give you a lot of control over how your desktop looks. Yes you can change the background image and arrange the apps however you like, you can even choose to have the dock disappear. Other than that, very little is left to the user to configure. I believe this is intentional to make using the Chromebook the easiest experience for the majority of users.Although it has not been an issue yet, I would like to mention that I wish that the memory was 4GB instead of 2GG mostly for longevity reasons. I will have to update this review if that becomes an apparent issue in the future.To summarize, I love the Chromebook and it certainly makes a very good laptop replacement, for now. It works great for my needs and since I am always around wi-fi. Also, this laptop is beautiful. Looks aren't everything, but beautiful things sure are inspiring.

580,"I paid $275 for this zippy little Chromebook, extra $$ for the next day shipping and it was WELL WORTH IT, WOW AMAZON, you continue to amaze me, ordered this thing at 2PM on a Monday, picked it up by 11AM on a Tuesday. Like my title says, it's somewhere between a Netbook & MacBook Air. The keyboard and silver back style is totally a mac knock off but it works. I think it's got a great little build to it. Keyboard flows amazingly, I have been typing documents & emails and it's a tremendous quality for how small it is. I'm a big dude, 6' 4'' with huge oaf hands and fingers, it still feels comfortable to me. This is a great little machine if YOU LIVE ON THE WEB. You're not going to do anything crazy with this. I had some skips while listening to a 30 minute clip from a radio show on YouTube and trying to do other stuff. I also had a little bit of trouble watching HBO GO. Then again, my network isn't an amazing connection, it's mediocre speeds at best. I bet with a better connection the video experience will be just fine. But for $249 you get a Samsung quality machine, with a mac feel, and a netbook performance. Display isn't going to blow you away but for $250 it's definitely passable. I also hear Netflix is making its own App for the Chromebook, which sounds amazing, I have a Netflix app will work great on this machine. I Love Google Drive storage and love that this thing boots up like a tablet. Its small enough to literally take anywhere and have a laptop-esque experience, without the booting up & Windows/Mac desktop booting for 15 minutes.I hope I continue to see more Google & Samsung combinations. I have a feeling the third version of this chromebook will be out of this world. They're certainly off in the right direction.

581,"Up until a few months ago, the Chromebook seemed to be a rather overpriced novelty; not anymore. As a 76 year old computer user with limited ability or experience, I find the Chromebook perfect for me. This noiseless, beautiful computer is perfect even removing the necessary task of having to manually back-up everything. I will probably soon add a Chromebox as my home computer is giving some problems yet I like the larger monitor for these old eyes.

This is annoying since I choose this device for school.The chromebook with connectivity issues is as useful as a toddler's toy, without batteries. I had to return to type to my BB Playbook.

585,"Samsung makes great products, this Chromebook does what it was designed to do.Problem is with Google not Samsung, Google falls short in the Chromebook system concept. If you are doing only 'Google' functions, this Chromebook system works great. An example is, it's near impossible to use Skype with the Chromebook.  Google makes an app for Skype in Android, but Chromebook doesn't do Android apps.  Why not?  That would resolve a LOT of issues.Anyway, Samsung does it well, Google needs to work on the Chromebook system so you can do more than email, browsing, and a calculator.  Ok, it's not that limited, but still very disappointing.

586,"Small screen, glitchy touchpad and extremely short key travel aside... this is my favorite laptop ever. It's tiny, doesn't get hot, doesn't make noise, stays on all day without plugging it in. And for $250, I can live with the aforementioned stuff.As long as it's on a flat surface -- table, desk whatever -- the touchpad isn't too bad (it's really the plastics around it that make it click when I don't want, so lap-use be warned!). Key travel is short but I've actually gotten used to it relatively quickly. And I've had tinier and worse-looking screens. Because of all the pro's about this, I'm not looking back. It's a stellar machine, and when put in developer mode I get a full shell (not that I need it; can SSH to any of my servers to work).As a web developer, I'm saying this is a usable machine. It glitches less than my desktop with 40 tabs open, and that's got a quad-core processor and 4gb ddr3! If all you need is a web browser and shell, buy this thing!

587,"I got the Chromebook because I wanted something light to travel with my work laptop along with something to pull up web pages when relaxing at home.I try to make it a habit to not use my work gear for personal use and having this along beats using my cell phone to pull up a random web page or try to do anything complex. I have an older Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet and the Chromebook is barely bigger. It doesn't have a touch screen but it makes up for that with a great trackpad and keyboard. The trackpad is larger than my work laptops and feels more intuitive. I also have no complaints about the keyboard. It doesn't feel like you are typing on a miniature device like a keyboard probably should at this size. The keys are large and very responsive so it feels very natural to type.Performance-wise, the Chromebook isn't the fastest thing in the world. It will stutter on occasion when watching a YouTube video but it really is quite rare. It can handle most anything you can find in a browser.Overall, this is a great little device. It will handle everything but the most intense productivity activities but is perfect to use as a second laptop when you want to jump on the internet or research something.

Besides that, the processor was a little slow, but that was about it.

Throughout the 6 hours of usage, the machine has crashed at least a dozen times, doing seemingly random tasks. I've tried disabling different extensions, full wipe, and other various things, but the crashes keep occurring.2.

Trackpad is excellent, far better than many others out there. Still not Macbook Pro quality, but it is certainly an improvement over other machines.3. LCD seems pretty crisp and clear.4. Battery is excellent. Meeting or exceeding the 6 hours it is rated for.5. Keyboard is fairly decent. Be aware of some flexing if that bothers you.6.

593,"After a year of heavy use we can say this about the Chrome OS (COS)and the Samsung Chromebook Wi-Fi (CB):1 Google thinks about the future and cares about the future of our planet.Google and 97% of climate scientists agree global warming (worldwideclimate change) and habitat loss are real and mostly caused by humans.The CB, the cloud, and the Net will soon get rid of printing (good for treesand the environment).2 The CB is simple but secure because Google knows that few people aretechno mavens and even fewer are black-, white-, and gray-hat hackers.COS relies heavily on cloud computing; the only people afraid of or worriedabout it are politicians, lawyers, bankers, and organized-crime heads (thescum of the world).3 Forget about malware, spyware, crimeware, viruses, worms, or bugs (likethe Heartbleed one); you won't have them using the CB.4 Don't worry about losing data because the COS is always saving as youtype. Which PC or laptop can do that?5 The ARM architecture makes the CB the quietest and coolest (not hot)device to access the Net. Lack of bloated software and antiviruses makesit also the fastest.6 You can (1) do online shopping, banking, bill paying, emailing, chatting;(2) write reviews, papers, articles, webpages, blogs, (scholarly) essays,(e)books, and your PhD dissertation; (3) make friends; (4) make moola(be careful of pyramids and Ponzi schemes!); (5) find a date; (6) type in52 languages....7 The CB is versatile and powerful--it can be used by three-year-old kidsand 100-year-young kids.

After a month of using it I look forward to a long and even more productive association. I was not at all intimidated by the slight changes in keyboard layout and function, because the tutorials are clear, concise and practical in addressing this issue and in providing information in every other slight or major alteration as well as in instruction for 'totally Google' innovations such as its wholly internet-based concept.

596,"What a great computer for such a low price. I take it to a coffee shop almost every morning and never have to worry about battery life. The keyboard layout is nice and big and I regularly video conference on it with my developer with no trouble at all. I'm sure if I was some kind of 'power user' then I might have some cons to give, but I just use it for keeping up with Google docs, email, and keeping my work life organized. Bottom line is if you regularly use chrome and have the apps and extensions set up to your liking then this would be a great 'work horse' computer to get things done remotely and on the fly.

597,"I could not be happier with this device.  The screen is pretty high-res, the keyboard is comfortable to type with, and it's incredibly light.  I have plenty of cloud services and apps I use, so I can actually use this device much of the time, without having to fall back to my Mac or PC.As long as you have a full PC or Mac, this device is epic.  If you don't have another computer, and don't use many cloud apps, this probably isn't the device for you - but for my purposes, I'm thrilled with it.

It responds very fast you open the lid and it's ready to go. I use it for browsing the web, reading email, and watching youtube videos. This is the only device I take on trips. I have had no issues at all.

600,"I read so many reviews before I purchased a Chromebook, and many of them were quite helpful, but there were those that went right over my head....so I thought I would just relate my experience for any other Granny out there.When my laptop started showing it's age I wanted to replace it with something just a bit more portable.  So much of what I need to do online (email, blog, message boards, and read) are not things I necessarily need to store on my own computer, but are places I just need access.  I know techies call it ""the cloud"".....I just call it....""out there somewhere"".  I knew I didn't necessarily need a huge processor or large amounts of storage ""space"", and I also love to take the laptop to a local coffee shop to people watch and write....so a good battery and something that doesn't make my shoulder ache were my goals.For the most part I'm happy with the Chromebook.  I was online and going within 5 minutes of opening the box.  The size is perfect for slipping into a large purse or small bag.  The battery lives up to it's 6 hour promise.  The keyboard doesn't feel as small as I feared it would, and is fairly comfortable to use.Now for the things that I didn't expect:There is no cap lock.  Hmmmm.....after 40+ years of typing I'm finding it hard to remember that fact AND it does make the transition from typing all day at work to computing at home a bit confusing.The ""two finger"" touchpad just doesn't work for me, I'm scoured the forums looking for some mystical magical trick that I'm missing to no avail.  There is no right click/ left click function, so things that used to be so simple like clicking on a word to use the spell check function or right clicking to open things in a new tab don't work.  I didn't realize just how much I used the right click function on the touchpad of my laptop.There is no delete key in upper right corner however, the power key is up there so I have MORE THAN ONCE turned the thing off in the middle of what I am doing.  I miss my delete key.  I miss highlighting unwanted text and quickly using the right click to edit, so I am finding that some of the usual chores I do online are taking me longer or I'm procrastinating them until I am home on the desktop.The last negative for me is that the keyboard is very sensitive.  If I stop typing (to ponder the meaning of life and everything) and allow my hand to relax then the cursor jumps all over the place and I end up erasing what I've written.So to wrap it up, for my use, the Chromebook is not comfortable for extending writing or blogging, but is great for checking email, surfing, reading and most other general things that I use a laptop for while on the go.  Great for travel, but when I am really feeling inspired and want to sit down and hash out some creative writing, the omission of often used keys, and placement of others leaves me feeling frustrated instead of motivated.10/08/2013 Update:I would not buy this product again.  If it were only for traveling and on the go it would be fine but it's just too hard to use for regular blogging and correspondence.  Often times while typing the cursor will skip around and begin typing in another place of the document, no matter how careful I am if my left wrist so much as grazes the edge of the Chromebook it will cause things to disappear, hop around and just be crazy.  With no ""harddrive"" everything is backed up immediately (so they say) but on 3 occasions I have written something at say -- a coffee shop-- saved and returned home only to find it completely gone, not a trace anywhere.  I barely have time to do things once, let alone twice.The lack of a delete key means if you want to correct something you've just typed you must maneuver your cursor, get behind it and backspace over it....way too time consuming when the Muse has struck.  Also .... can't skype on it.  Tried calling Skype for help -- nope--- they claim it's not supported, so my dream of skyping with the Granddaughter died.  Many programs I use daily I can't use on my Chromebook....like Swagbucks.  Hey....I love saving money with my Swagbucks but the toolbar won't load and Encrave just will not run.So...if you need an extra device for things on the go, it's still easier than using the Kindle .... I don't like email on my Kindle.....but if you need to actually get down and dirty and do some work....this machine might not be any better for you than it has been for me. !12/2013I have to replace this with something easier to use.  It simply will not allow me to upload photos.  Not from my camera, not from the SD card, not to Facebook, not to Google+.....it simply doesn't not work.  Maybe Santa will bring me a real laptop?

601,"Very pleased my new machine, and I recommend getting the EEEkit advertised along with the Chromebook.  Literally no learning curve with the Chromebook.  Connected to my home network immediately and had a concise tutorial upon startup.  Glad to be moving almost entirely to the cloud.  Got this for use during my full-time MBA.  I'll leave my windows machine at home and do Wake-on-Lan and RDP for accessing my statistical software.  Subtract the $120 of free 100 GB storage and the cost is $130.

602,"I wasn't expecting a whole lot and I got way more than I bargained for. I still can't believe this laptop is only $250. I have been an Apple user since 1989 and this is the first non-Apple computer I've ever purchased. I got this as a second (or third) computer as I have an iMac as my main system and an ailing MBP circa 2007 that is still chugging along. I was looking at replacing the MBP with a Macbook Air, but was balking at the pricetag. I really didn't need it to do any heavy lifting in terms of video, photo or web work, but mainly to catch up on email, keep up with scheduling, do some research and use office documents. I've since found a lot more uses for it...For me the killer app on this system is the Remote Desktop app which means that you can access your main system remotely and use any app on that system, save to Google Drive or Drop Box and you're good to go while away from your office. It is small, light and very quick. I've had zero issues in the three weeks I've had it. I'm happy to be free of Apple's spinning beachball (curiously never happens when I'm buying something from their store...), the weight of my old MBP and am super happy that this cost me a sixth of the cost of a Macbook Air!!!Cloud computing is easy to get used to. Google makes it ridiculously easy. They will need to beef up their app store to make this viable in the long term and I believe they will do it.A quick note for Canadian customers. You're going to have to purchase this in the US and bring it back with you. A lot of Google's products like Google Play for music and movies don't work in Canada which really sucks. You only need the wifi version as the 3G is pointless here. There are plenty of great apps to do what you normally do in those bloated, overly expensive Mac apps (can't speak for Windows), it's just a question of finding the appropriate equivalent. To be honest, my MBP is sitting on my desk with the lid shut collecting dust. I don't have to think twice to take the Chromebook with me as it is so small and light. The build quality is really impressive, maybe not as sexy as a MBA, but definitely well built. Samsung and Google have really done an incredible job! Well done!!! I can't recommend this little laptop and Chrome OS highly enough. If you're on the fence, get off and pull the trigger.Now please get those great apps working in Canada. If it is about local authorities and licensing, then let us know exactly where we as citizens of this country can put pressure to get our monumentally stupid politicians to relax the rules so we can all play - happy to do it, just need a target for the arrow.

603,"Initially bought this as a ""helper"" PC in the family.  Has become something of a workhorse PC.I was using Google Docs for everything on a PC anyway before purchasing, so there was no mental shift for me to go into this machine.Likes- Awesome battery life- Lightweight- Fast bootup- No strange messages to update your OS, and then dealing with the reprecussions (Microsoft, take notes)- Low priceDislikes:- You tube video streaming can often get audio / video WAY out of sync; its as if the video can't keep up.  Often, YOU Tube full screen videos are a bit glitchy.  If this is what you want to use for a lot of movie watching, this may not be your machine.I need to emphasize the my likes FAR outweigh the dislikes.  I am seriously consider buying another one to replace a brand new HP split running windows 8.  Windows still doesn't understand how to make a seamless operating system, unfortunately.

The chrome operating system had me confused at first, but ultimately set up was very easy.  I went out immediately and purchased a wireless mouse which works fine.  I was also able to easily figure out how to get documents to print to the wireless printer in the house.  For the money I consider this a great buy.

I'm very impressed with the design, and it is quicker then I expected. I was also thrilled when I plugged in my old DELL mouse, and it hooked up right away. I would recommend this to anyone who like to travel, or is just looking for a alternative to windows. I love how it is absolutely quiet, and their is very little heat. I cannot express how thin it is, a friend of mine saw it, and almost didn't believe the price, and he used it for a awhile, and was very impressed.

I clicked on it and then went to Amazon.com to check it out.  The other reviews on this product really helped me decide to order it for myself.  That and the fact that it was sold out online and at my local Best Buy.I ordered it from Amazon.com and just paid for regular shipping.  I was pleasantly surprised that it arrived the next night.I opened it up and logged on and started exploring!  How fun is this!  It has all the conveniences of a labtop without being complicated.

I couldn't get past the lack of a physical keyboard.Along comes the Chromebook, which for roughly half the original price (and less than a Nexus 7"") seems like a great value proposition.  That is, unless you spend considerable time browsing on it.  I don't mind the 11.6"" screen, but the brightness (200 nit) and resolution are pretty bad.  It reminds me of Samsung's own Galaxy Tab 3: a similarly disappointing screen, although that is a similar resolution over a much smaller space.  My comparison, I LOVE the bright, saturated display on my Galaxy S3.That said, I would not hesitate to recommend this (at this price) to family members who are not as picky about their technology, or especially if they need a budget solution get on the Internets and want a physical keyboard.

I wanted it to do two main things:1) Adequately allow me to accomplish all the stuff I do on my computer OTHER than playing games, namely browsing the internet and paying my bills online.2) I wanted a really lightweight and hassle-free travel computer that would do everything listed above.I already have a Nook Color for my e-reading, and really wrestled with whether I should get a newer full-on tablet.  In the end I decided that a real keyboard (and not just a chintzy little Bluetooth keyboard) was more important.  Because honestly, if you get a tablet and then keep it in a special faux leather case with the Bluetooth keyboard bundled together, what's the point of getting a tablet instead of an Ultrabook or something?Assessment: As I wanted, this little Chromebook successfully does all I need it to do.  Manage your expectations (it's NOT a full-on laptop), and know what it can and can't do.  It powers up in less than 10 seconds, typing on the keyboard take very little time to acclimate, and it is light as a feather.  Living in the cloud takes a very small bit to get used to, but I am loving it.  My main complaint is that it doesn't fit in my satchel (manly Indiana Jones leather satchel!) like I hoped.  Other than that, I have zero regrets.  $249, and this sucker is worth every penny.  Try finding an ultrabook, or even a respectable tablet, for that much!**Side note: I already ordered a refurbished Alienware from Newegg.com that will allow me to play my games.  Chromebook and desktop - no more heavy desktop replacement laptop.  Even with both of those items, it's cheaper than what I spent on my souped up Dell laptop two years ago.  If the Chromebook dies in two years, not a huge loss financially.  If something in the Alienware dies in two years, I just swap out the corresponding parts on my own.  Win!

It is super fast!!  When done, you simply close the lid.  This little laptop is absolutely wonderful and I highly recommend it!

633,"Let me go ahead and say this now: I'm a computer engineer and programmer, so I purchased this laptop for much different reasons than other people did.The Samsung Chromebook in itself is a nifty little product - it's small, lightweight, fast for its size, and it has incredible battery life. Of course, the reason this is true is because it doesn't have an internal hard drive, which is what sucks the power out of every other laptop out there and adds at least a few pounds to the weight. But for what it's worth, $250 is not a bad price for this little machine. If someone is going to buy this product for internet surfing, listening to music, maybe doing a little bit of word formatting or etc., then this does the job. 5 stars.However, on the flip side, this machine as a PC really can't do a lot. You can't download programs onto this laptop and do what you would typically do on other computers. I haven't taken a look at any Google Apps that you can download, but chances are, they aren't as powerful as regular programs running on a Mac or a PC. It's basically just a fancy internet browser, which happens to sync your settings via your Google account. So, if you're looking for a small laptop which has the same capabilities as a regular PC, this isn't it. 2 stars.As for me, I purchased this product with every intention of modifying it and changing it to my own needs. Since this computer has two USB slots (2.0 and 3.0) as well as an SD card reader, I am booting an entirely different operating system (Xubuntu 13.04) off of the SD card. Since I am using a completely different operating system than Chrome OS, I am able to run programs on this computer normally like any other laptop or PC, and I basically have modified everything to suit my own needs. If you would like to try this (it has few bugs here and there, but I have fixed them all), visit this awesome tutorial right here -[...]REMOVE THE SPACESFor my purposes, this laptop gets 5 stars. Works like a charm. If you have any questions and need help with the process, feel free to contact me by commenting on here.

634,"All I needed this for was basic internet surfing and e-mailing. This was pretty much ready to go out of the box. The easiest to set up! My only issue is that my Cisco wireless router came with a disk for install. I happen to have a USB disk drive handy so I was fine with it. Just an FYI for others who plan on installing programs with disks on the computer. You need to get a detachable drive.

635,"My daughter wanted a laptop and i honestly didn't think we needed one. we have 4 ipads and i have two logitech ultrathin keyboards for them (one for ipads and one for the ipad mini). I ended up buying this refurbished for about one hundred fifty dollars. I love it. it lasts a long time, it works well for browsing the web and using google's assorted services. it even works well for flash games my son will dabble in (nick jr.). this is a nice little device to have around the house.

636,"I've been using my Chromebook for about a year now, using it almost daily at home and traveling. It's small, light, has good battery life (I get about 8 hours with intermittent use), and pretty much hassle-free. OS updates are automatic, files save automatically, there are apps available to do almost anything you want, and screen is good from text and video. Netflix is now supported!Downsides. Despite the protests of chromeheads, it really is just a browser--no internet and it's pretty much just a paperweight as most apps are served out of the cloud. The tight control over the OS and apps has locked out open source software such as Open Office, LibreOffice, Banshee, etc., and the Chrome alternatives just aren't as good. Games available are lame.A downside of hassle-free is that it's difficult or impossible to save a Google Sheet or Doc in another format if you want to move files between apps or share with a non-Chromebook. Formatting and functions available in the Google Office apps are basic, but a user used to MS Office or any of the open source alternatives will be disappointed.  The last automatic OS update has screwed up my ability to access my daily e-newspaper, and the lack of a roll-back has me in deep yogurt until the bug is discovered, diagnosed, and fixed (my non-Chrome devices still work).The keyboard has a nice feel, but its non-standard (PC) layout can be frustrating, e.g. the lack of a delete key (it's alt-backspace), no F2 edit, etc.In short, I like it to check my email and browse internet, especially while traveling, but Chromebook is handicapped by the lack of 'big boy' apps and games.

637,"I originally purchased a cheap Windows 8 laptop because I wanted something, in addition to, my iPad and iMac for surfing the web or word processing in bed. I quickly sold it and bought this Chromebook. It's everything that I wanted and more. It's perfect for that person who wants a laptop for word processing, surfing, watching videos and listening to music. It's cheap, durable and is very thin and light. Not to mention, it boots up and shuts down in 10 seconds. I am now sold on always buying a Chromebook.

638,"I got my Chromebook several days ago.  I've worked with it for a few hours and am keeping it.Pros- Great value for the price- Super light- Easy to import favorites- From what little I've done with Google app.s, they  seem to be reasonable- It does save and apply the passwords I'd like to save, e.g., my email passwords and a few other who-cares-if-I-lose them sites- Starts up in just a few seconds- Decent speaker for the price- A decent amount of background options- Works with a mouseCons- Wi-Fi is really, really slow.  I've run several speed tests at speakeasy.net against my Windows laptop and the Chromebook is woefully slower, so any video at all stops and starts a lot Update: When I place the Chromebook next to my router, it runs great. 15' and 1 wall away, it's bad.  It must be the Wi-Fi antenna.- The base documentation is negligible.  I had to use help a lot to figure how to change settings.  For example, how to reset the clock to Central time isn't at all easy to find- Since there's no offline app.s, I had to buy a cloud password manager for my financial web passwords at $1 a month.  I know, not a lot but it's more than free- The keyboard isn't very tactile.  It feels cheap- Despite having a cursor speed control for a mouse, it doesn't seem to affect the speed so it takes a lot of mouse movement to get the cursor across a screen- Printing may be a hassle, but I don't see myself ever needing to print anything from it anywayLike I say, I haven't used it a lot yet but it's a keeper so far.  This Chromebook will never be a workhorse laptop, but is fine for surfing.

639,"I'm giving this 5 stars not because its a perfect laptop but because its perfect for our needs. My 7th grade student needed a light weight laptop to use at school and home and I didn't want to rent one from our school.  The Chromebook's set up was super fast and easy to do.  The Internet connection is fast and my son loves how quickly he can pull up his school work.  Google Doc and Slides and easy to use and similar to word and power point.  Instead of saving files on the cloud we prefer to save to a jump drive.  Simply put...it's was exactly what we needed for our 12 year old student and it will still be perfect for years to come.

640,"Review Update #2 (latest):-----------------------3.5 months since I got this and I've been settling in to using the Chromebook on the sofa while watching TV.  (I'll go back and forth with my iPad and this.)  Well tonight, the Chromebook's trackpad stopped working.  WTF?!  ChromeOS forums on google say that the trackpad gets overly pressed down (or overly ""depressed"" ha hah) and the ""fix"" is to try and bend back from the bottom of the case.  Tried that and it was a no-go so it's going to get serviced.  I'm sending it back to Samsung for warranty service but c'mon -- 3.5 mos?!you get what you pay for ...  Maybe I should have gone for the real deal of the Macbook Air 11 inch ...Review Update #1:-----------------I have warmed to it as it has become my sofa device while watching TV in place of the iPad.  Still you can only check one gMail account at a time via a browser.  On the sly, I installed the native ChromeOS Remote Desktop on my work machine to get around the VPN issue and it works.  But the main drawback with the native ChromeOS Remote Desktop is while remoting into the host work desktop, the host work desktop screen actually displays the session instead of being hidden like how the native Windows Remote Desktop Protocol works.  I have to remember to shut off the host display if I'm remote desktopping.Initial Review:-----------------My first impressions having this for 24 hours.  Feeling a bit disappointed with the features it lacks as my original purpose was to use it to connect to my work network.  VPN support is very limited as of March 2013 -- Two types of LT2P/IPSec and an OpenVPN.  My office uses PPTP so this poses a huge problem.  And I found an app that allows you to connect directly to the Windows Remote Desktop protocol for work.I was expecting this to be the Cubic Zirconia to the Macbook Air and it is!  The one thing I noticed is opening the lid.  It may sound silly, but I've become used to opening a laptop like my Macbook Air with one hand by just flipping the screen open.  With the Samsung Chomebook, I have to use two hands -- one to hold the bottom part and the other hand to lift the lid with the screen.  Maybe the hinge needs some WD-40.

642,"It took a while but I was fortunate that someone returned one of these to Amazon and I was able to pick it up for less than the advertised retail cost. I have been sitting in front of computers for near on four decades now. Spent plenty of time using Windows machines at work and even had some early windows 'ultraportables' such as the Sharp Muramasa. For home use, I went with AAPL at the launch of OSX more than a decade ago and have a house full of those machines, both desktop and laptop. This Chromebook just amazes me with that history.This thing is1. amazingly affordable. 2. amazingly light 3. amazingly energy efficient 4. amazingly high performing. What you need to understand about this machine is that performance is fully a function of your internet connection speed. Below 10Mb/s it gets a little laggy. With a wifi signal above 10Mb/S it works like a champ. My other laptop is a 15"" MPB with a processor rated at about double the speed of this machine and more RAM but can you tell a difference at internet speeds above 10Mb/s? No. Would I rather take this machine with me when traveling and have full access to every web site that I normally access via laptops and desktops in my home? Yes absolutely. Should you get one of these? Yes. Sure, if you spend a significant amount of time on the machine you now have using some local software program, this is not the machine for you. If you, on the other hand spend the majority of your time in a web browser. You want one of these. Just don't be an a$$ and pay more than what GOOG or AMZN is selling them for new from some scalper. Get one when you can get one for 250 or less.

I've been using it for over a month now and I cannot see myself going back to my Macbook anytime soon. Google's applications are more than enough to compensate for what the Macbook has to offer. This is definitely a great purchase that I would recommend to anyone who has the money.Likes: Price, weight, keyboard, Google Drive is a dream, doesn't get too hot, quick and simple to use, the screen isn't really that big a difference from my Macbook, either.Dislikes: It's not as fast as you may think, the keyboard can stick sometimes (I tend to slam on it), and the fact that I didn't get two.

653,"I'm going to preface this by saying that I have a 17"" MacBook Pro that is my workhorse computer, but I needed something smaller that I could carry around, take into classrooms, and use on-the-go as well as in my home. I bought this tablet for several reasons: 1) I wanted to try the Chrome OS; 2) I needed a versatile laptop that I could carry with me everywhere; 3) I needed something I could travel easily with; 4) I needed a laptop that would allow me to work on my dissertation wherever I went.The good:1) The size is nearly perfect. It's not too big, nor too small, to handle my larger hands. The keyboard is laid out well and provides comfort.2) The screen is matted (which I prefer) and provides an easy viewing.3) The weight is amazing. This feels like it weighs less than most of my tablets (Asus Transformer Prime, iPad2) and packs just as easily as any of them.4) The speed in which it connects is fast -- no matter where I go.5) I received 100Gb of additional space on Google DriveThe bad:1) There is a slight noise in the trackpad area where my wrist rests. It sounds like it pops up and down -- but this is intermittent and hasn't even happened in a week.2) I have had some trouble finding a few networks when I've traveled -- networks that I can find on my phone and/or tablets. In one case I gave up and just used the TPrime with the attached keyboard.Overall, I would highly recommend this computer if you use Google products extensively, if you use the internet extensively, and/or if you do not need proprietary software installed on your laptop. Since I am writing my dissertation in Google Drive, this fits my needs.

654,"EDIT 8/15/2013  SCREEN DESTROYEDWell, I've just had to go ahead and change my rating from a 5* product to a 1* product, I've been using the Chromebook on and off for class and it had been performing quite well (see below review and edit) however I turned it on today after about two weeks of non use (it has been sitting in my closet in a case on a shelf) and there are cracks spiderwebbing out from the bottom right hand corner!  I know that this is not due to ANY misuse as my there is no cross device usage between my wife and I (she has her ipad etc. and has been away for work for the duration) and it shut down perfectly fine.To reiterate, there has been NO PHYSICAL DAMAGE, there isn't a mark on the thing, no drops, no knocks, the screen has been opened from the center at all times so there is no twisting.  Just...spiderweb cracks everywhere.  Apparently this is classed as physical damage and user error by Samsung so their warranty doesn't cover it.  I googled the issue and found MANY other people finding the same thing, also reporting that Samsung don't seem to be aware of it (also be aware that most extended warranties that do not explicitly state repair of user error damage will not cover this e.x best buy).  $250 might be cheap but I expect something to work for longer than nine monthI'm basically left with a brick now unless I want to go to the trouble of trying to find a replacement screen from screen surgeons or someone.  A shame, I have a samsung phone, fridge, dishwasher, microwave, soundbar, and am writing this on a samsung tv. and this is the first product that I'm ashamed to have bought into so readily, it feels cheap (but acceptable for such a low price) but the sheer poor screen build quality and lack of owning up to the problem have soured me on at least another of these products from them.  I'll be looking elsewhere for a replacement.  I'm sure that thousands of you don't have this problem, but I've just became one of those one star people whom I always look at and wonder ""Why one star if everyone else loves it"", for things like this.=============================This arrived yesterday, came well packaged and secure (though only paper was used by amazon to secure the chromebook box within the main package).  After unboxing and turning on (for some reason it would only turn on the first time when it was connected to the mains power supply despite it then being at 98%, it's been on and off since then, I think it could have been a user problem?) the setup couldn't be simpler, just log in using your google account...and that's it.The build quality for the price is excelled, nothing felt 'hollow' or unsupported, the keyboard is very satisfying to use, as is the trackpad and multi touch.  I thought that the screen wouldn't be very bright having read some of the other reviews but at max brightness it was definitely bright enough for me!  I happened to find 1/2 to 2/3 brightness better to work at.  The keys looks nice and the dedicated browsing buttons are great and take the place of F1-F12 etc.(as you no longer need F keys).  my only turn off is that after typing for a few hours there was already a patina of grease on the space bar  from my thumb (I was my hands, honestly!) that I'm going to keep on top of with chlorox wipes (I guess it's good for hygiene) but that surprised me as it took a 'long' time for my last laptop to show this shine on its keys (mostly because I was wearing the plastic away from use).All the 'apps' work as you would expect and look basically like their online counterparts (most of the apps are just links to the online versions) though you can use documents offline and they will be uploaded next time you connect to the internet, you can also choose to sync your google documents and download your files for use offline (not sure how this will work if I go over the storage limit of the chromebook...or where they're kept when they can be used offline as they're not in the ""files"" folder.Connectability seems good, USB ports, AV out, SD card slots etc. all present, the power supply seems a weak spot in the back if you knock it off a table or drop it, looks like it's waiting to snap off due to it being very thin.  I heard that the bottom scratches easily so assumed that it had no support pads but it does...so I can only assume people are resting it on their laps on ... zips or something, it seems fine to me.Battery length...is awesome.  I sat and types for 3 hours + online last night on 2/3 brightness and the adaptive battery monitor but me at around 55-60% with 4 hours left at that useage level so it definitely does what I need it to in that aspect.As we all know, Netflix is not working at the moment on this due to the ARM processor but it looks like it's in the works, hulu works as does pandora etc. and crunchyroll for those who like anime so that's nice.You can easily customize the background etc. and the in built camera/mic is nice for vid chatting though you're currently limited to google vid etc.  having the guest option is a nice touch, I can just hold the power button once, log off and someone else is on instantly to browse around (basically puts it into incognito mode so nothing is saved).  Startup time is around 9-10 seconds to the desktop depending on how fast you can type your password but it's about 7-8 seconds to the main login screen as promised.Google drive is easily upgraded and adds onto whatever google drive is associated with the first account you log in with.  I'm still not sure how to get my internet passes but I'll worry about that when I actually a) need them b) go on an airline where I can use them.  I don't think I could ever use my 5gb so 105gb is a massive amount.  I haven't tried streaming video from google drive (not sure if that's even possible) but if it is that could be a nice compromise from movies on a flash drive/SD card.Google remote looks promising if you don't mind keeping your main pc on at home as you could theoretically load programs on that and remote control it to display on the chromebook (correct me if I'm wrong).Once I've used it more regularly I'll update this with any problems I've found but so far Samsung appear to have hit it out of the park and I have zero actual complaints (no start errors requiring reloads that other users seem to have). Would definitely recommend.------------------------------------------Edit: 4/9/2013I use my chromebook for my extended campus program (about 5 hours at a time) and I've never yet ran out of battery or came close, with lower brightness settings, not using speakers etc.  just wireless and typing I can get 8 hours.  Average life is dot on 6 hours as promised.  As a build issue I have noticed that the trackpad on the bottom right is a little lower than the left, easier to click, I don't know if this was intended but it hasn't gotten worse and it's not that noticeable but I thought I'd mention it.The auto update works flawlessly (I had a minor issue when I changed my google password but once it connected to the wifi it asked me to update it), you get to use sites like hulu and crackle along with Netflix (I hear, I haven't tried yet myself but apparently this has been a recent change!)If you're looking for a replacement for your desktop pc (or even your traditional OS laptop) this isn't for you, if you're looking to supplement it, go right ahead, you won't regret it.Also I've never seen any of the problems that the 1 stars have mentioned, black screens, dead, having to push reset, not finding wireless etc.  I think it could have been a bad  early batch.

Kind of a silly set up as you would think there would be a communication with Amazon and Square Trade. Oh well.

664,"I've had mine for about 2 weeks now and can heartily endorse the Samsung Chromebook (SC). I make my living off the Internet and was working within 5 minutes of taking my SC out of the box. I can't add anything more than all the previous posters have so I'll leave a few tips & tricks:ALT + backspace is the delete keyIf Hulu is jerky set Hulu to HIGH, not HD or AUTO. Netflix is on the way. YouTube works fine.The screen is fine - gets better with use. If you stand to either side of the SC or hang from your chandelier you can't see the image but I don't stand to the side and I hate chandeliers so I sit in front of all my devices and in that position the screen on the SC is fine. It would be nice if Sammy or Google would add a contrast slider as that would bring out the image.I never liked standalone progs so have been in the cloud before it was named the cloud. I put everything up on Google Drive and it all seems to work fine - films stream okay on the SC, music sounds good, images look cool, docs appear as they should. Put Google Drive on all your devices and you'll have global access to all your stuff. I haven't used SD cards, thumb drives, etc on the SC as I'll either temporarily copy something over (like a film I want to watch on a trip somewhere) or leave it on the Drive.Sound is good - I think the SC has a spatializer because it gives a surround sound effect out of 2 small speakers. Sound is really good with headphones or through a speaker systemA light touch on the touch pad works for me - real gentle. Once you get used to using 2 fingers for certain options you'll be zipping around.Connection to WiFi was instant for me - I know some have had problems. I set up my printer connected to my Windows desktop on Google Cloud Print a few months ago during an idle moment so was pleasantly surprised when I was able to print immediately from my SC.It's cute but it's plastic so keep that in mind if you're going out & about and don't leave it anywhere it can be sat on. My Sammy netbook could probably take being sat on, my Sammy Chromebook - well, I think not, so be warned.That's all I can think of. The SC is a fabulous new way of computing for those of us that live online and don't need exe progs. I can't recommend it highly enough. Enjoy yours.Merry Xmas & a Happy 2013.

I use this about 99 % of the time.No more paying for anti-virus, anti- spyware, registry cleaners,and other things I needed to keep Windows working..I have paid more for anti-virus and anti-spyware, than I paid for the Chromebook.I wish this was available years ago.

This Samsung Chromebook has some competition from other brands but the build quality on this from Samsung is excellent. Recommend especially for university students and anyone who would like a lightweight, fast laptop substitute.

667,"I bought this Samsung Chromebook  one year ago.  I needed it for writing and basic internet use.I like that it is light-weight.  When I first bought it, the internet connection was strong and fast.  However, after a few months, the Samsung would not connect to my wi-fi network.  I have to do all sorts of tricks to get it to connect to the internet like opening and closing it a million times, and shutting it down completely.  Sometimes I get it to connect to the internet, only to have it shut down minutes later, repeatedly.This computer only has Google Drive for documents, and you cannot edit a Microsoft document in it.  This has led to many work-related problems for me.The g-mail chat does not work; the camera doesn't work, and neither does the microphone.  I called customer service, but I was on the phone listening to their recorded New Age music and constant voice overs ""your call will be answered in the order it was received.""  A half hour later, I was still getting those messages.  I called back the next week and the customer representative was unable to correct the problem.Additionally, this netbook cannot read a simple voice recorder inserted into the USB drive, and it cannot connect to a universal DVD drive.  It's like Google is trying to protect the user from outside influences.I would not recommend this netbook.  It is horrendous.

668,"OK< Chromebooks have their limitations. No storage (or almost none) and everything is in the browser. All that is good. The construction is great (again, for $249), the screen is pretty good (again for $249) and really, it does the job.Flash makes the browser crash every once in a while, and when you have 10 tabs open, it runs a little slow...but it works as advertised.

I can do almost everything I did with my PC, except Netflix and Photoshop. But I am sure I will soon be able to get netflix on this chromebook also. And there are tons of apps , some even similar to photoshop. I would recommend this Chromebook to anyone who needs an inexpensive way to do most anything you do online.

671,"I ordered this Chromebook laptop after much consideration and reading reviews of others. I normally hate giving feedback or reviews of anything. This purchase, however, so impressed me that I felt compelled to give it proper praise.If you read the other reviews and understand the limitations of a cloud based system, and know what you are getting into, you can't go wrong with this for the price.I was a little disappointed at first because I missed my Microsoft Excel, but after a little trial and error research, I realized that MSN's Sky Drive has a full cloud based suite of office applications that worked fine once I figured out how to access and attach them to e-mails. This is the only computer I use now.I do love it.

679,"If you only need a notebook that can write papers and go on the internet, this is perfect. The small size makes it extremely portable and the SSD gives it a quick boot time.  Though, this notebook should only be used for basic needs. Anything more than watching a video on youtube should be done on a better machine. I personally have a desktop PC in my dorm and carry this chromebook to my classes and it works just fine. Also, if you need to access a high-demanding program, there is the option to use google remote desktop. What this does is allows you to control your desktop (mine is in my dorm) from your notebook. This allows you to use high-demanding programs on your desktop from anywhere with an internet connection.This chromebook is great for someone looking for a portable machine, but should also have a better desktop at home.

680,"I've been very happy with my Chromebook. It's lightweight and the keyboard feels good to type on. The dimensions of the screen make for some smallish typefaces while web-browsing, at least at default settings, but the screen is clear and I'm not constantly running out of room or having to scroll. Processing is fast enough for me, even when i have seven or eight tabs open. Non-HD video plays fine.A month or two after I got the Chromebook, the battery wouldn't charge, and the little charging light wouldn't light up. I think I'm pretty careful with it and don't travel around with it in a bag or anything, so I'm a little concerned about the Chromebook's durability. The charging jack almost has to be forced a little; it's not the smoothest-working.The Samsung website does not make it easy or convenient to open a repair ticket. Even though the Chromebook is under warranty, I had to pay shipping to the Texas repair facility. They did not keep me updated about receiving the Chromebook or where it was in the repair process. I could track it on the website, once I found the obscure corner where it could be looked up.The scheduled repair date was several days after they had received the package. The actual repair date was a day or two after scheduled, with no explanation. Overall, they seemed to be in no hurry and feel no obligation to keep me updated. The website asked for my feedback, but only in limited and annoying ways (e.g., a pop-up that obscured the screen I was trying to look at to ask me how helpful it had been).The impression I'm left with: the Chromebook is good for as long as it's good, but Samsung customer service is nothing to inspire brand loyalty.

If you're getting one for a student in your household, just get one.

682,"REVIEW UPDATE:I'm knocking 1 star off my original review. It's still a wonderful device in many ways. But don't you just hate it when something starts our stellar, and then somehow manages to degrade over time? Well, that's what's happened with ChromeOS on this device, in my opinion. A month or two ago, I reported a couple bugs, one of which described significant degradation in boot time. The first few months that I used the device, it was just under 10 seconds to get to the login screen, and negligible time after logging in before the device was useful. Well, something changed such that the initial boot is still maybe 10 seconds, but now there's a solid 20 seconds of nothing but black screen after logging in. No progress indicator. Nothing. Just a dark screen.The first time it happened, I thought perhaps my machine was hosed. I've since somewhat gotten used to what I now consider a 30 second overall boot time. In other words, who cares if it's only 10 seconds to the login screen, just for the privilege of waiting another 20 seconds for the device to become useful? That's rather disappointing given one of the big selling points was the quick boot time. I acquired a Lenovo Thinkpad in roughly the same time period, which had Windows 7 pre-installed on it, and although I haven't timed it, I'd be surprised to discover that Windows 7 was taking longer than 30 seconds to boot. The last thing I want to be feeling is that I'm booting no faster than Windows, if you know what I mean.Another disappointment is that a developer responded to that bug by listing a several step process to try the next time I experienced the problem, which I think would result in being able to obtain and provide them more debug information. But you know what? I didn't spend a couple hundred bucks to become a gratis software developer/tester for Google and/or Samsung. I reported the device I'm using, and the OS level/build. It seems to me that companies with such deep pockets should be able to debug this without my help, or should at least be throwing me some kind of bone for helping fix their products.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I've owned many, *many* computers over 3 decades (I began the madness with a Timex Sinclair in the early 1980's). This is the only computer I've owned where the pleasure/pain ratio is greater than 1, where I'm not in a constant state of denial about the amount of effort/pain required to keep the OS up to date or install applications, the amount of agonizing over where files live, the amount of sitting through tedious reboots, the amount of wondering why things don't seem quite right after emerging from ""sleep"", etc., etc., etc. (it's hard to remember all aspects of the nightmare when you're halfway decent at denial). MS Windows always required huge amounts of denial about such things. Linux was better, but even there you wound up spending a lot of time as an admin (which is fine if you enjoy it... but do you? really? are you sure?)This little wonder just plain works.I have tiny gripes, but they're simple and reasonable given the price point. The screen isn't as large as I'm used to. The sound quality could be better (it's tinny even in earbuds). I wish the balloon that announces how much battery life I have when I plug the power supply in wouldn't appear at all. A Google Doc session will occasionally lock up (seems to be if/when I'm typing too fast). Browser tabs refreshing was an issue until I enabled the experimental memory caching option. Opening a Javascript intensive page can degrade audio/video playback a bit. The keyboard isn't back-lit.But, really, other than those trivialities, it's been glorious. I wasn't expecting to run numerous CPU intensive processes concurrently. It connects to hotel wifi without the usual struggles or mysteries. It boots from dead off as fast as advertised, and comes out of sleep essentially instantly, and with no ""sleep side-effects weirdness"". Just boom, and it's there. It's very light and quiet (no fan!).I can't express how wonderful it's been to no longer be cursing the day that personal computers were born. I'm doing all the fun things I love, but none of the admin, maintenance, or worrying about viruses. Every now and then it tells me that the latest Chrome OS is ready to be installed the next time I reboot. That happens quickly and efficiently. Totally effortless.I've read that I could boot it in ""developer mode"" so I could play with the devilish details. While it's nice to know that option is available, having experienced the bliss of *not* sweating the details, why would I open that can of worms again? Okay, my geeky ego could find moments of pleasure in that kind of pain. But the part of me that just wants to listen to streaming music, watch streaming videos, network socially, and read about the insanity also known as the human species is ecstatic that it doesn't have to sit in a stinky pile of techno dung to do all that.Kudos, Google and your hardware partners like Samsung!

The keyboard is great, the mouse pad is great, the screen is more than sufficient for daily use (brightness and resolution).  My only disappointment here is that the video card cannot send an analog signal through the HDMI port, this would be helpful for projection, as many projectors in use still have only a VGA input, and is a feature that some tablets, and ultrabooks have - not a huge deal, I would have preferred to know this before trying to run it through the same HDMI to VGA cord that works with my other devices.Again, this is a great product.

No printing.  Google wants you to use Google print which needs a Google Print Server.  One is included with the Chrome browser but you need to keep another PC one to use it.  Not very practical if this is going to be only PC in the house.What is needed is a small Google print server appliance sitting on the local network.  The Rasberry PI crew is working on this.  There are also new printers with the Google print server installed, but it doesn't help people who already own printers.

689,"I'd read a glowing review about a tech writer's experience with the Acer Chromebook and decided I'd like to try one and since Samsung is making some great hardware these days I decided to get it instead.I was pretty disappointed with it and with the Chrome OS when it came.  The good news is it's very light, the bad is that it feels somewhat cheap and plastic-y.  I don't like the matte screen at all as things don't look sharp and clear, whether text or images.  I tried hooking it up via HDMI to my 24"" ASUS monitor and even there the image quality was poor.  I'm used to Windows and the big monitor and crisp looking images and text and don't want to regress to the level the Chromebook is at.I also didn't like the trackpad.  It had that annoying tendency of jumping the cursor just as you went to click the button part of the pad.  You're better off using the tap to click as that avoids the jumping.  BTW, it seems the trackpads on many of the new devices coming out are a bit flaky.I wasn't impressed with Chrome OS.  It didn't seem snappy or fast or robust.  Once again it felt like a big regression from using Windows 7 or 8 or Android 4.2.  I kept wanting to touch the screen as I'm spoiled by touch enabled devices and thought how much I'd rather just spend a little more (well actually about double more) and get a Windows 8 touchscreen device.  I also own a Nexus 7 and 4 and I'm very happy with Android so it's not just a Window's bias.The best thing I can say about the Samsung Chromebook is that it is light and portable.

Unlike a tablet, you can use this keyboard like a completely normal one. It is completely productive.We have had no problem with speed. It has kept up on everything we've tried. Well, when I've played music from Google Play it plays very well. However, it really hurt the multitasking. The speakers are pretty good for a computer this small, but they certainly aren't great for listening to good music. So, the playing from Google Play really isn't an issue.This is almost a fully functional small computer. However, you have to be able to work in a completely Web based world.

697,"I have had my Chromebook for about 2 weeks.  So far it has definitely been worth the shipping wait (it was backordered for 1.5-2 weeks)...halving the weight and doubling the battery life of my old laptop for $250 has been worthwhile.An important point to recognize is that this computer will not run programs (.exe) like iTunes, so analyze your computer usage.  I used my previous laptop ~70% for web browsing, ~15% for document editing (text & spreadsheets - mainly through Google docs), and ~5% for iTunes syncing/music management.  Google does offer Chrome Remote Desktop, an application to interface with another computer.  If you have iTunes or other programs you would like to run installed on another computer, you can set up remote desktop to allow you to play with those programs on that other computer.Battery life is impressive, averaging about 6 hours a charge.  My battery is currently at 36%, and the Chromebook estimates I have 2 hours 17 minutes left.  It also does not get very warm and stays comfortable sitting on the lap.  It is very quiet (no fan, so no fan noise).All in all, I would recommend this product for people who are looking for a web browsing-only laptop.

Screen is decent, though certainly not an IPS - you'll have to properly adjust the viewing angle for best result.I use it mainly for webmail & web browsing but have loaded some mkv video on Google Drive and they play back fine.  I have also used google docs (word processing) and google sheets (spreadsheet) programs and found them to be intuitive and similar to MS counterparts.I just purchased a $10 license for ChromeRDP which allows me to remotely access my Windows PC.  I do realize that Chrome Remote Desktop does essentially the same thing, but was put-off by the Google TOU, seemed a bit intrusive irt my privacy.Note that I intended to dual-boot w Ubuntu, but have been so pleased w/ ChromeOS that I've had no need to do so yet.  I almost pulled the trigger on the cheaper Acer Chromebook, but in the end I am so glad I  waited for this model to come back into stock.

700,"There is a good reason why near 3 thousand people left review for the Samsung Chromebook and most agreed it is a darn good machine for the price.  If I may let me say a few words too about not specifically the hardware, but rather why I decided to buy Samsung Chromebook and why now. Many of you may agree, right now it is a terrible time to buy any kind of PC including notebooks.  Haswell on the way, revision of Windows 8 at the cornel, SSD mounted ultrabooks on the rise that cost thousand or more and of course the buzz around Chrome OS uncertain with its Packaged Apps direction.  So, why did I decide to buy a Chromebook and picked Samsung? For the Chromebook a single, most darn good reason is security. I am still using Windows XP and I prefer to use free programs to do things, like You Tube downloader, file type converter, media player and so on. However these freebies often saturated with spywares and no matter how well I try to protect my computer, soon or later I'll get hit. Before I bought my Samsung Chromebook my Google account was nearly hijacked. You can understand I really don't want to share my stuff with just anybody. The solution is a Chromebook. It is near impossible to get infected, so being secure is exactly what I wanted. As far as why I picked Samsung is pretty obvious.  Best keyboard, has all the connectivity, long battery life, light weight and probably the best is it has no moving parts, not even a fan and yes, of course the price. If you are looking for a Chromebook look no further. You may have to buy another Chromebook 6 month later, but right now is a very good if not the best choice you have. So there you go.Updated: 10/23/13Having a wireless network at home allow me to use my Chromebook anywhere around the house. It is very handy and spoiled me to that point I hardly use my PC anymore. Using the Chromebook is joyful simple. Just open it and there you go, continue where you have left. Same thing for putting aside. Just close it and it is done.I watch lots of YouTube videos. At night after I went to bed I pick for example a stand-up comedy and let myself fall asleep. When the video finish  the Chromebook puts itself into sleep mode too. My goal is to turn the Chromebook into an eBook reader, perhaps having a timer with it.The big drawback of course is it doesn't run Skype. I know there is Google's Hangouts, but I am sorry the World at this moment running on Skype and Google should acknowledge that and should do everything to work it out with Microsoft to make Skype running on Chromebook. At this moment nothing could boost Chromebook sales better than that.Updated: 3/10/14It is almost 6 months that I have purchased this product and I like it more than eve. Since my purchase many more new Chromebooks came out, but I still would buy Samsung. For one reason is its fan-less design. Sure the new Intel's Haswell chip seems to be faster, like Acer C720 series using it, but it has fan, which means you have to careful not plug the went hole. This one you don't have to worry about that, using it  in the bad, or placing the unit over something soft material, like comforter or pillow is no problem. I just like that freedom. Besides, speed is never was an issue for me.My Chromebook working for me many ways. When I am sleeping it download files, like .avi files.  When I am watching TV and I want to find out where Sochi is I just reach for my Chromebook and map it. If need a word or some kind of references, again I just rich for my Chromebook. Social network, emails, reading online magazines, post photos and many other activities my Chromebook is beside me. I also purchased a Chromecast. One of my best spent money. It is working wonderfully with my Chromebook and watching for example YouTube on the TV is a surprisingly different and very enjoyable experience. And finally don't think about Chromebook as a PC or a full-fledged laptop replacement, because it is not or at least not yet, but rather a media device that do a lot and for some  perhaps it does enough that you don't need any other computer.

701,"I ordered the Chrome Book because I wanted a portable device for note-taking and document access. (While I originally considered an ultra-book, I decided to keep separate applications with sensitive data like Quicken from other cloud-based documents. Based on that concern, I elected to maintain a home-based laptop and to buy the Chrome Book for on the go.) At $249, you cannot beat the price for the Chrome Book.The Chrome Book is extremely light-weight (~2 pounds) and meets my standards for portability. The keyboard is very comfortable and easier to use than a touch screen with either a stylus or an add-on keyboard. (I admit that I find it challenging to type on a touch screen and that I don't like fingerprints.) The device looks stylish.From a set-up perspective, it is important to ensure that your wi-fi encryption is set to WPA2. (Our router was originally set to use the older standard of WEP.) When I first turned on the Chrome Book, the device was extremely slow - taking many minutes to access a web page. As soon as I changed the encryption standard, the Chrome Book speed became good and responsive. If you are currently using WPA2, set-up is as easy as turning on the device and signing into Gmail.If you don't have wi-fi access, the Chrome Book does allow you off-line access to both Gmail and Google Drive.To gain full utility from this device, you need to buy-in to using Gmail and Google Drive. (You can access MS Office docs on a flash drive.) I have been impressed by the collaboration capabilities with Documents on Drive. (If you are committed to using Outlook or another reader to access your mail locally, the Chrome Book will NOT work for you.)Google makes available 100GB of storage on Drive for 2 years if you buy a Chrome Book. In order to take advantage of this storage, you need to search for Chrome Book ""goodies"" online.A disappointment with the Chrome Book is that you cannot access the New York Times application with off-line availability. (You can sign in and read the NY Times with the Skimmer application. You need wi-fi connectivity to use the Skimmer.) While I pay for an online Times subscription, the Chrome tablet application will not work. Every time you try to access an article, it prompts you to log-in but it then routes you back to the home page instead of opening the article. (If you look at the reviews on the Chrome Store web site, many users report the same problem.)While the Kindle Cloud application will allow you to access your newest book via the Chrome Book, it will not allow you to access your subscriptions.)I think this is a good device if you want a portable gadget for office functionality. If you are traveling and want access to entertainment, I don't think this is the optimal device. (Without a memory stick add-on, you can't download media for access without wi-fi.)

704,"We bought two of these Chromebooks back in 2012 for our then 11 year old son and 14 year old daughter. They are still working despite the fact they have been dropped multiple times, have gone on every vacation, college visit, etc. The only thing wrong at this point is that after years of heavy use the screen goes in and out and you have to adjust the angle of the screen to get a clear image.  This has happened with actual laptops we have owned previously that we paid more than $500 for and their screen issues all started within three years. The screen issue has to do with the opening and the closing of the device at the hinged area. I will be purchasing another chromebook or two (for my husband and I) by October of this year when the two we have reach their end of life date. Chromebooks are a very affordable way to have a device that handles most of what a person wants a laptop for, streaming, googling, email.  They are not for college students, a true computer is needed. Save the money with your kids and get a chromebook. Wait to invest in a PC or Mac for when they go to college.

705,"Chromebook offers a whole new way of computing.This model is light weight, travels well, and starts up fast! Data and programs are on the cloud, so can be accessed by login from any computer. However, it cannot be used with programs that must be downloaded, so no Evernote, though I do use Spotify Web with it. Also, email can be accessed offline with Gmail offline.Very compatible with gmail/google and Android.

She absolutely loves this chromebook and she is hard to please when it comes to electronics. The 2 years of free 3G is perfect too (if you don't need more than 1gb per month) The Chromebook is build well, the keyboard is excellent.

707,"This Samsung Chromebook came on time. Once, I received the package I thought it was a big computer. When I opened the package it was a small normal laptop package. I opened the small normal laptop package up and saw that the laptop was really small. I am able to type as fast as I normally can on this Chromebook. The keyboard really does remind me of a Mac book. The Chromebook barely makes any noise. I love it. However, the cons of this chrome book is that it doesn't support Microsoft Word and you have to set your printer up to a cloud print which I still need to learn how to do. Otherwise, its a light, small, enough space computer you can carry to complete your school work on the go.

712,"I've had this Chromebook for about 2-3 weeks now and so far it's been working out pretty great for me. I am pretty experience with computers, so I like to think I know what I am talking about, and this has been working excellently for me.I, myself, have a pretty powerful laptop,but it is also really huge, which i did not realize when I first bought it, but I quickly got tired of the size. I got this Chromebook to use in the times that I don't need a high power laptop and would rather use something more small and convenient and this is great. I also had bought a tablet in the past to try and this is a million times better.Pros:Starts very quicklyWakes from sleep quicklyConnects to wifi fairly quickly, and auto reloads your pages if you tried to go to one before it connected100GB free google drive for 2 yearsSmall, light, and very convenientlong battery life(6+ hours, much better than my other laptop)Keyboard and touchpad work nicelyFlash player built inturns on when lid is openedvery cheapCons:No support for things like silverlight or java(yet)Can only do browsing (not a problem for me since I have a second computer, but might be for some)You CANNOT install anything that isnt through the chrome web store (add ons for chrome)touchpad click does seem a little cheap, but still worksWhen it comes down to think and thin, it just matters if you need a computer that does more than browse the internet. I don't, because I have my other PC and all of my homework is on the internet anyways. I do need to use my other PC for things like programming and some other things, so if you don't have another windows or mac, this may be a problem.Other than that though, this is a very convenient, great device for the price. It loads web pages pretty quickly and can handle most things you can throw at it. For the price, I would definitely say it is a good purchase.

It is perfect for emailing, checking the news, using Google Calendar, browsing the web in general.  It USED to be good at streaming video, but I've already griped about that.

It amuses me when I read the reviews that people are still not reading exactly what aChromebook does, and then leaving reviews that are less than flattering.  A little homework goesa long way and between the product description and helpful reviews you should be able to know exactlywhat you're getting and what it will do. I use this mostly for internet, email etc. and have never hada single problem with my first one in the last year.

717,"I'm a full time student and was sick of my computer kicking its fan on because it randomly decided to start downloading a Windows Service Pack in the middle of the day while I was trying to take notes.  It was a full-sized, full-powered Sony Vaio and it was bulky, heavy, and loud.  When I heard about the Chromebook, it seemed like a great idea, but I was apprehensive about learning the new OS and not being able to download Windows programs.  I would like to outline some of my initial concerns and put them to rest for anyone who is thinking about getting a Chromebook:1. ""I will miss all my Windows programs!""  I doubt it.  If you're looking for a computer to take with you to school, then everything you're going to do can be done online.  You don't need Office or anything like that when you utilize GoogleDocs, which YOU WILL LOVE.  Now that all my documents are in the cloud, it makes updating them, sharing them, printing them, all so much easier.  If you're worried you'll miss your games, GoogleApps has thousands of them that seem awesome.  Plus, if you're looking for a timewaster between classes (or during?) you can still access Facebook and Pinterest!2. ""I'll have to relearn the Operating System."" True, but you'll learn it immediately after you try something the first time. It's SO fast and so efficient and it's only the things you need.  It's Google, so it's intuitive.  Now, when I go back to use my desktop or someone else's laptop, I really see how streamlined the Chromebooks are.3. ""Isn't 11.6"" going to be to small?"" Not at all.  I've seen some netbooks that are tiny and I hoped beyond hope that the Chromebook would be big enough and it absolutely is.  I'm super short, so in lecture halls, I always had to look over my old 15"" laptop to see my professors.  I can see over this comfortably and the screen is PLENTY big to see everything (and the screen is beautiful and crisp!)4. ""I've heard it won't run at all if you don't have an internet connection."" Phooey.  It runs fine, it just isn't connected to the internet.  GoogleDocs has an offline mode and once you're connected again, it automatically updates for you.Last couple points - make sure that the first time you set it up you have WiFi access.  Ideally, one where you don't have to have full credentials (user name AND password) like I did on campus.  That part was a little tricky.  Once it boots up for the first time, it's really easy to get connected, but I wish it would boot up completely *before* you had to hook it up to wireless.You won't be able to download printer drivers because those are set up for Windows/Mac.  You CAN login to Google on a computer that DOES have the driver and it serves as a sort of printer router for the Chromebook.  Setting it up was SHOCKINGLY simple and worked the very first time.  And, obviously, since all your documents are in the cloud, you could just log into another computer and print from there.  ALSO, Google has some CloudPrint ready printers, so if you are also looking to buy a printer at this time, I'd say do it in conjunction if at all possible.I promise you won't regret this laptop.

718,"I never thought I would buy a laptop with no hard drive. I did. And it's wonderful. The Chromebook made by Samsung is light - about 2.4 pounds, thin and has a 6.5-hour battery that pretty much is exactly that. And it boots up in 10 seconds. And it performs all the primary functions of a laptop – email, chat, word processing, etc. And performs them well.The catch: You have to like Google products. A lot. The Chromebook has no hard drive, just a small flash memory with room for it’s Google operating system (similar to Android)  and any of the apps you choose from the small list available.  So everything you do has to be done via the Cloud. Specifically Google Docs, Spreadsheet and Presentation — now all part of Google Drive. Music and Photos can be enjoyed through the machine once added to Google+ or Drive.The other catch is it is largely a WIFI machine. You can link it by wire to your internet modem and there is a 3G/WIFI version but if you have WIFI in the house or visit Starbucks, McDonalds or live in a digitally connected town, it works wonderfully. I don’t do a lot of heavy lifting on the computer – don’t crunch numbers, don’t play involved games, etc. Just email, browse and write. And this is a laptop that fits those needs.The best catch: It cost $249.

722,"I received my Samsung Chromebook on 1/17/2013. Yesterday (12/16/2013) the battery went dead. That's 11 months - 11 months of daily use, with AM/PM charging and 4-6 hours of evening use.The replacement battery is $45. Needless to say, I am not too happy about this.Apart from this, the Chromebook is a neat browser machine. However, more than once did I wish for full compatibility with Windows. For example, some financial charts do not work because of Java issues (I filed a report with Google but no response to date).  Compatibility with Windows spreadsheets and docs is there in principle, but in practice, you just avoid it (too many issues and too much work to go back/forth more than once).

723,"I own 2 MacBook Pros and a number of desktop Macs. I love my Macs.The pros vs. the cons of Chromebook ownership for me are as follows:PROS1. Affordable. Very affordable for a laptop.2. Almost everything you do is stored in ""the cloud"" - mostly on Google's servers.3. Since you can store everything in the cloud, there is little or no risk of your data being stolen from the computer. The 16GB of onboard storage almost assure you that documents you create on the Chromebook will be stored in the cloud.4. Your cloud files can be accessed with other other computers, Macs, PC, tablets, smart phones, etc. with the right login credentials.5. The Chromebook is small.6. It is very light. Easy to carry around and take anywhere.7. The 11.6 inch screen is more than adequate to do work, view online content. I have no problems with screen resolution.8. Most of the time I do not need to remove it from my travel bag when I have to go through airport security.9. Streams audio very well.10. Google allows you to store up to 16,000 of your favorite songs for free on their Google Cloud Music player. Those songs then can be easily streamed back to the Chromebook or any other device.11. Other audio services such as iHeart Radio, Pandora, Amazon Cloud Player, Spotify and Tuned In Radio work just fine.12. If you do only one video stream at the time, the Chromebook works fine.13. While it has a tablet processor, it also has a keyboard... so yes, it is like a tablet on steroids. I picked this over buying an iPad Mini.14. You can plug USB devices into the ports so that you can also use a mouse, USB memory stick, and even an external hard drive.15. Of the 2 USB ports, one of them is USB 3 the other USB 2.16. Can run on battery all day without much worry of having to recharge.17. Many free online apps are available at the Chrome store.18. Several tabs can be left open on the Chrome browser at the same time without taking much of a performance hit.19. The Chromebook is fast enough for most users. I have no problems with the speed of this device.20. As a secondary computer to my Macs, this fits the bill well.CONS1. You need to be in the vicinity of a WiFi hotspot to get the most out of the Chromebook. If you have WiFi at home, work or school then you're good to go.2. If you are on the road, then you are at the mercy of finding a WiFi hotspot that you can hopefully gain free access to.3. I subscribe to a MiFi device service which is an extra monthly cost.4. Offline mode could be improved. The built in apps for music, video and photo playback are crude at best.5. Offline Gmail is sluggish.6. The OS could use a better desktop interface. It is a little clunky transferring documents to an external device.7. Offline documents have to be stored somewhere, and the 16 GB of onboard storage space is quite limiting especially since the Chrome OS uses the same space.8. I wish the Chrome browser was like the one I have for my Mac where the app icons show up on the browser window itself instead of being stored in the icon mess at the bottom of the task bar.CAVEATS1. When you travel (especially at airports and overseas; anywhere where your computer could face inspection or even seizure) be sure that you are completely logged off your Google account and that the computer is completely turned off.2. You should be logged off your Google account should you be away from the Chromebook for any length of time.CONCLUSIONI use my Chromebook a lot. As a secondary device to my Macs, this is a fine computer to use on the road when you need to do something quick and dirty and yet maintain a level of security that you cannot find in other laptops (no documents stored on the device). Plus its web browsing capabilities are good as just about anything else since Google is at the core of its existence.

I suggest you have another computer at home to use so that after you're done finishing whatever you need to finish with this chromebook, you can access it at home and complete your work on an actual PC. For example, when I'm at Starbucks or in the library, I use this chromebook (yes you can use it offline as well) to type a paper; however, I don't have Microsoft Word, instead I use Google Docs. So when I get home, I access it on my Google Drive then I can save it to Microsoft Word and make the changes I need. By then I can print and do whatever.

728,"I purchased this in January 2013. It was my first venture into the curiosity that was Chrome OS. At the time, it was the first successful Chromebook laptop. Now (March 2014), there are more competing solid options out there (and more will come out), so if you are trying to decide, price becomes a bigger factor now.I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it, especially compared to sub-$500 Windows laptops. Now let me preface that by saying that I am using this as a secondary and special-purpose computer, not as a primary computer. Having solid state storage (like tablets and smartphones) is great. I do not have to worry about ruining the hard disk while moving around with it. Other things equal, solid state is faster than a hard disk. This is especially important with budget hardware. There is something to be said about not having to hear Windows churning on a slow-spinning hard disk while a computer. On the other hand, if you like to store a lot of media and content locally, 16GB is not a lot. There is an SD memory card slot and two USB ports (one 3.0, one 2.0) and other options and hacks, so you have some flexibility, but obviously it's nowhere near the 320GB or 500GB of most sub-$500 Windows laptops. So that's one decision point right here. If you need a lot of local storage...If this is your first Chrome OS computer, there is one thing that might be jarring at first: there is no CAPS LOCK button. Google replaced that with a Search button. The CAPS LOCK on/off function is achieved by pressing the ALT and SEARCH buttons together. A CAPS LOCK arrow in the tray at the bottom right corner of the screen signals that CAPS LOCK is ON. There is no keyboard light for caps lock.The keyboard is very serviceable. I have no complaints typing or touch typing with it, especially considering the price range. Likewise with the touchpad. The screen is serviceable as well, given the price range and it is the good old 1366 x 768 resolution found in many Windows laptops, still to this day. This is not a touchscreen. It is perhaps not ideal for watching a lot of video, but again, this is not a premium laptop or a premium tablet.Being a 11.6 inch size type of a laptop, there is obviously no numeric keypad and the assorted buttons. However, it has smaller serviceable 4-way arrow keys at the bottom right side of the keyboard. Not as nice as a full-size keyboard for sure but they are serviceable.Because it is fairly small and lightweight, depending on your preferences, you can sort of use it while walking around, cradling it diagonally with the inside of your right side elbow holding the front right side and your palm holding the back left side. Or the other way round with your left hand. A touchscreen would make this holding style more useful, but because it's small and lightweight enough, I still like using it this way.This is best suited for internet-based tasks. Checking emails, browsing the web, doing quick lookups or small online tasks, social media, shopping and window shopping, checking news and sports and stocks, and the like. A great use for this is a second screen while watching TV.Battery life is pretty good. You can play with the Sleep and Wakeup (or not) options to see what works best for you. Often I just have it turn off the screen when I close the lid, so when I quickly need to do something, it only takes single-digit seconds before it's ready to go. This obviously eats up more battery, but it is a more elegant solution than having a desktop running non-stop day and night in case you may need it.This may also be a good idea if you have visitors or overnight guests, especially if you don't want them using your personal or work computers. Just hand them this or put it in the guest room. They can use it in Guest mode (it's like an internet kiosk mode, it wipes all the data once the guest logs out) or if they prefer, you can add their Google account to it, and they can login with their Google account and have all their google services ready.The ability to have multiple Google accounts added to the device and login to them is also handy if you regularly have multiple people using it (kids, roommates, relatives, friends) who want to keep their usage separate and not accidentally walk over another person's data or accidentally send emails from others' accounts. Or if you have multiple Google accounts of your own (personal, work, hobby, etc).Performance wise, this is better than its specs suggest - if you consider the equivalent specs running Windows. Chrome OS (at least for now) is a lot more lightweight than Windows. However, if you start opening multiple websites, it can start slowing down, especially if you are visiting some of the bloated websites running all kinds of performance-sapping widgets.In terms of apps, it has nowhere near the number of apps traditional/classic Windows has and nowhere near as many as iOS or Android. However, there is a Chrome Web Store that is slowly but steadily adding more apps offering some more flexibility. Still this does not (yet) come anywhere near the selection (and compatibility) you get with Windows, convoluted as it may be.The biggest downside I can think of is that you are living in a Google-centric bubble. You can use it in Guest mode, however, Guest Mode is like an internet kiosk, the moment you log out, everything is gone. No saved passwords, no bookmarks, no downloads, no Chrome apps, no history. So to make the most of it you have to use it logged in with a Google account. Some people have privacy concerns with Google having access to so much of one's data stream. So this is another decision point.Because the browser is essentially the operating system, Chrome is the only browser you can use. You can customize and tweak, but can't install other browsers like you can on Windows or Android or iOS or Linux.Overall, this is a great value as a secondary computer, especially for web and cloud type of work.

729,"So one has to wonder,  this laptop is pure genius but also strange.I am used to the top of the line Mac Book Pro / Air computers.  So when you start using something like this quality shows.  But this laptop is 250 dollars.  So you basically have to put your expectations in a laptop that costs 750 to 1750 dollars cheaper then what you are used to spending.Pros:Laptop does what you would expect, Chrome Web browser,  and the laptop as a whole is driven by the Google products you use.Plays Flash Video,  like youtubePlays video streaming services like Hulu, NetflixHas SD card slotHas pretty impressive battery life 5 hours of youtube videos.Supports two finger scrollingCons:While chrome OS works great to operate the computer and give you the Chrome browser.  You find yourself missing the ability to play other web browser based games.  Like my son's jumpstart.comCheap constructions shows with weird behavior like being able to click the track pad from the bottom front of the laptop.I did notice it struggle to play youtube videos with multiple open tabs,  something to do with limited ram, closing out some tabs that had other flash applications helped.Overall I think this is great for anyone who either A doesnt know a lot about computers since it saves you from microsoft updates, antivirus etc.  Also in comparison to tablets, it provides the desktop chrome browser experience with a real keyboard.So a good test if you could use this laptop as your main machine,  go into a current computer,  install chrome browser,  and live in it for a week.

731,"I bought this for school because of the light weight, long battery life, and price point. So far it's functioning exactly how I want--I've used it to look at readings in class, take notes for a student org meeting, and kill some time in the library.Being a regular computer user, I am finding the touchpad and scrolling system to not be as intuitive as I am used to, but it's not difficult to learn.The one downside for me is that there isn't enough offline functionality--I realize that that's kind of the point of the chromebook, but I would like to be able to do one or two basic things without having to be connected to the internet. If I want to work on a paper but I can't get wireless access for whatever reason, this thing is basically a brick (a sleek, shiny, lightweight brick to be sure) rather than a sophisticated piece of technology.I would recommend this product to someone that maybe wants a supplementary computer for greater portability and basic functionality, but probably not for someone that doesn't have access to any other computers at all.

733,"I think there are plenty of reviews to point out the great things about this chromebook, and they are absolutely correct. This is a great small, light laptop that's great use when lounging on the couch or to travel with, especially when your main focus is to simply browse the web. There are certainly other useful ways to use this (games and apps), but I think the target audience here are people that prefer to browse the web on a device with a keyboard (which sets this apart from a tablet), and may use it for other tasks sporadically.The one issue I have is that I tend to have ""heavy hands"" when I type or use the track pad. By this, I mean that I put a lot of weight on the palms of my hands on each side of the track pad (below the keys). I use a 13"" macbook as my main computer and this has never been an issue; however, with the plastic construction, this is an issue with the chromebook.The issue is when I use the track pad with my right hand. I leave my left palm resting to the left of the track pad and when I do, ""clicking"" the trackpad by pressing down doesn't work. There is a software feature which allows you to tap the mouse for clicks, but the issue I'm talking about is the physical click by depressing the track pad. The times this is most noticeable are the following:- When resting the laptop on a soft surface, such as your lap- When the laptop is on a hard surface, but the front of the laptop hangs over the edge a bit.- This is kind of hard to explain, but sometimes when I'm walking around with my laptop, I hold it with my left hand with my four fingers on the bottom of the left side, and my thumb on the top, squeezing on the laptop with a firm grip. This allows me to use the trackpad when I'm standing, walking around...  When holding the laptop like this, the trackpad click also fails. This is probably not a practice done my most people though :)* If the chromebook is on a hard surface (table) without hanging over the edge, this issue is not seen.What's more interesting is that this only happens if your hand is pressed down on the left side of the track pad. If you use your left hand to control the track pad, (with a heavy right hand), you won't notice this issue.I think having a macbook with it's aluminum unibody has given me bad habits because the construction is so solid, but when we're talking about a $1,500 price difference between the macbook and chromebook, I think it's understandable. The chromebook is a $250 laptop and you can't expect the construction to be on par with macbook. This is just a small annoyance and when it happens, I just have to remember to lift my left hand to allow the the track pad to work properly.Aside from that, I love the chromebook and find myself using it more than my macbook now because it's so light and convenient -- not to mention, you feel more comfortable casually carrying it around since you are less concerned with damaging an electronic device that is so cheap :).Sorry, one more thing -- There is no right-click with the chromebook -- you use a two finger click for a right-click functionality (one finger for left click). I like this, but when you are using multiple laptops, it's easy to forget.**** Update ****I have a terrible time streaming youtube vidoes which is why I'm assuming netflix is STILL not supported. Youtube definitely has its own issues, but I have streamed the same video side-by-side with my chromebook and macbook, and have no issues with the macbook. Furthermore, my download speed is 45mbps and upload is 5mbps, so this is not a bandwidth issue.You can pause the video and allow it to buffer (youtube only buffers so much so it may be necessary to pause several times while watching a video), but should that really be necessary? Chromebook has capable hardware, so this must be a software issue. They have fixed another major annoyance I had to deal with for a few weeks (chromebook wouldn't ""wake up"" when opening the lid and a hard reboot was necessary). I hold out hope this will also be addressed, but I would probably give this review 3 1/2 stars at this point and find myself having to switch back to my macbook more and more.If you like to stream a lot of video, I would NOT recommend this laptop at this point :)

734,"Update at end.Great, and it only took about 10 mins to get up and running after charging including 6 mins for the OS update.Pros:-Quiet, no fan or mechanical disk drive.-The best keyboard.-Matt HD display, no reflections here.-Automatic OS update.-Lightweight.-Battery life looks very good so far.-Solid WiFi connection.-Battery charger works at 240 V as well as 115 V.-Small. I was amazed at just how small and thin it was when I opened the box.-Does not get hot.-Sensitive touch pad.-I like the 2 finger scrolling, and the alt-backspace for ""delete"" too.Cons:-None. At first I did find it hard to open up, but if placed flat and you then lift the lid with your thumb and let the base hang down, it's easy to get your fingers in there and open it up. So let the weight do the work for you. Also lower case on the key caps was a surprise, but no problem.Overall I'm very pleased with the Samsung Chrome Book quality, and the delivery/shipping box.This was from newegg, the amazon order isn't here yet.Written on Chrome. Made in China.Update:-The unit from Amazon arrived eventually and it is identical and so the same remarks apply.-While using unit 1 the keyboard locked up (?). I found that using the paperclipreset through the emergency hole on the back worked OK after the charger power was connected.It's now back in service.

739,"I've had my ChromeBook about a month and am very satisfied with it. I've also had a Samsung 7 Plus and Nexus 7 tablets, and also currently have a Windows 7 laptop, Windows 8 Desktop, an iPad 2 and a Kindle PaperWhite Reader. Since getting the ChromeBook and the Kindle readers I find that I use the iPad much less than I used to. The ChromeBook is used mostly for Email and web browsing and for these activities it is about equal to the desktop and laptop, and superior to the iPad and the 7"" tablets. For me the ChromeBook provides about 95% of what I would use a laptop for while the iPad provided only about 80%. The Kindle at one-third the weight of the iPad is much more enjoyable to use for reading books, but magazines and newspapers are better suited for the iPad. I'm getting about 8 hours of battery life on the ChromeBook, the keyboard is good, the trackpad is excellent and build quality is acceptable. There is absolutely no maintenance on the ChromeBook. Google automatically updates it  every 6 weeks and Anti-Virus software is not needed. A cold boot takes about 10 SECONDS and it wakes from Sleep in 1 SECOND. Keep in mind that only Google Chrome applications can be installed and run on it. Also keep in mind that you must be connected to the Internet for most of the functionality. But there are hundreds of free applications, games and extensions available directly from the Chromebook. All in all it is well worth $249 and at 2.5 pounds (3 pounds with charger and a carrying case) it's easy to carry on trips.

748,"This is a Chromebook.  It's not intended to be a windows replacement although I bought it primarily to replace my laptop.  I found that 95% of my time was on internet, not on native windows apps so I gave it a try.  I had previously tried to do that with a tablet and found that there were times when I wanted to type more that getting out the bluetooth keyboard and connecting were just too much trouble.  What I have done is put my 17 inch heavy laptop in my office and set it to never sleep and closed the lid.  On the few occasions I need to do something on Windows then I just simply use Chrome Remote Desktop and remote into my laptop to do it.  Now I've found that my tablets and the Chromebook almost completely replace my need to haul my laptop around the house.I had a few issues with this device primarily around WiFi but I suspected that was because it was so new and the Chrome OS was not yet mature on these.  I changed to the Beta channel and sure enough my WiFi issues were corrected with the next release of the OS.Aside from that there are some minor irritants like the USB 3.0 port and the headphone jack being tight and having to push too hard to get the devices in, but these aren't too important.  Without these issue I would have given the device 5 stars.The speed which the Chromebook boots and is ready (about 10 seconds) and the speed which it awakes from sleep (about 3 seconds) is simply outstanding and makes this a tremendous portable device.  The number of apps available for Chrome is excellent and even the display works perfectly even though it is not high definition.  I barely notice the text resolution and I didn't buy it for a HD video experience so that is not an issue for me.  The 100G of storage offered in the cloud with this device makes it a steal.This is an inexpensive device SO DON'T EXPECT THE BUILD QUALITY of an expensive device.  That said however, the build quality is certainly fine and the chiclet keyboard is excellent.I highly recommend this device for anyone who mainly is connected in browser.  It is much more convenient than a tablet for typing and much more portable and faster than a laptop.  Well done Google and Samsung!

749,"Update - decided to keep it and give it another star.First of all, I might say that I'm a little indifferent to the Chromebook - hence the  (original) 3 star rating.  I have the last return date circled in my calendar, and have the bubble wrap and box all ready to go.  Meanwhile I'll try to find out where it fits (if anywhere) in my computer collection, and if I can adapt to the Chromebook world.  If I keep it, I'll give it another star.Years ago, when you used a computer to do serious work, you used a terminal connected to a larger computer.  An unconnected terminal (even an ""intelligent terminal"") didn't do much on its own.  It was a rather care-free life.  If you terminal stopped working, you simply found another one and picked up where you left off.  Viruses (at an individual level) were unheard of.  I think of the Chromebook is a modern interpretation of the terminal.  You get all the advantages (statelessness, no individual viruses, no software to install, no maintenance), but it needs to be connected, and your experience is only as good as what is on the other end.First of all, the hardware is top notch.  I could easily give it 5 stars.  It's silent, lightweight but solid, and the display is very good.  Battery life seems to be better than most laptops, but not quite as good as an iPad.  In terms of performance, I'd say it's better than any Windows machine near this price range.  My favorite test is scrolling rapidly through a Facebook news feed.  It's almost as fast as a high-powered Mac.The software/OS is basically a web browser with a LIMITED set of plug-ins.  unlike an iPad, you have Flash available, and there is some magic to allow you to save a few things off-line, access external drives, etc.  Apart from that, you probably can't install plugins.  The Java site says I don't have Java, but Wikipedia sound clips work (yay).One amazing feature is remote desktop access.  I can barely read what I'm typing, but I'm typing this on my chromebook connected to my mac. I think this just made the keep decision.Although you can minimize the web browser, there doesn't seem to be much point.  There is an ""app store"", and the most common price seems to be ""free"".  ""Bookmark store"" might be a better term (a ""bookmark store"" is a great improvement over one well-known browsers habit of simply filling your bookmarks with its choice of bookmarks).  Some apps (such as Evernote) are simply the same as the web interface available to everyone.  Email is limited to web-based email (luckily most email providers and corporate email servers provide (usually awkward web based interface).  A few ""apps"" seem quite pointless - such as a ""wikipedia"" app which does nothing but display ads in the margin while you read genuine Wikipedia articles with the margins cut off.  Google maps is the same as the awkward web version (two-fingered scroll = zoom, scrolling means clicking on the little compass circle).  Many Google ""apps"" create several tabs for simple operations.  For example, reading a book via Google Play may open 3 tabs (only one of them is the book).  This can get a little confusing. Then again, the whole tabbed interface avoids the issues of having multiple programs open, each with its own tabbed interface.Finally - (despite the hype, but true to the fine print) offline behavior is currently VERY limited.  I was able to edit a Google Doc (Google Docs are kept off-line) without wifi, and the document synced as soon as I was back within wifi range.  Perhaps other sites will gradually acquire Chromebook off-line behavior, but for now don't expect to work offline and pop into your local cafe for a quick cup of coffee and daily sync.  The good news is that you can ""try out"" the Chromebook experience using any type of computer that runs Google Chrome.  This might save you a trip to the post office.

The keyboard is pretty standard, the only thing I don't really like is not have a start button or a delete button, although I'm used to that already because of various other laptops used.The only cons are not being able to use things such as iTunes on it.

Let me first tell you what I was looking for in a laptop, (since I already had an hp laptop that's about 8yrs old and pretty slow): I wanted something light, easily portable, had extended battery life, easy to navigate, dependable, and CHEAP!!And personally the chromebook delivers. I use Microsoft word at work, but I find it easy to convert word documents to google documents and edit them online. I mainly wanted a computer that I could write creatively on as I am working on a book, as well as surf the internet when i'm decompressing from work.

Google drive saves all of my documents every single time i make a correction, so i never have to worry about losing any data. the internet is fast, the chrombook itself is very lightweight, easily transportable, and has an amazingly long battery life.I was afraid my fingers would be cramped on the keyboard since the screen is only 11.6"" however I type with ease. the trackpad is designed that of an apple, and i am used to the old fashioned trackpad with two lower ""left click/right click"" functions. However it was very easy to get the hang of the single trackpad, and now i find myself trying to treat every trackpad as such.Overall, if you are looking for an affordable and transportable notebook for internet and document usage, you really can't beat the samsung chrome. it also has a nifty webcam that i have yet to try out!

767,"There are dozens of in-depth reviews here, so I'll just leave my two cents on my personal experience:My lifestyle has changed. I don't do much more than web-based work when I'm on the go. My phone meets most of my needs on the go, but when I need to sit down and do a bit more work, I wanted a laptop rather than a tablet. I flip-flopped about this for weeks, debating Chromebook vs. Nexus 7. I settled on the larger screen with a quality keyboard for the same price.If your lifestyle is like mine, where you can do most of your work on your home or work computer and maybe you have a high-end phone that fills in another big part of your technological needs, a Chromebook may be a good solution for you.99% of what I do syncs to the cloud, so it's nice to have the same files available at work, on my phone, or on my Chromebook. It's a snappy experience to use the Chromebook and the 3G connectivity is a good backup when you're on the go.For those of you that are interested, check out ChrUbuntu for running Ubuntu on this ARM-based Chromebook. It's still in alpha as of this post, but may be worth checking out. Frankly, for $250 I am very happy to have a decent screen, a top-notch keyboard, USB 3.0 and an SD Card Reader. With wi-fi and 3G connectivity, I'm confident in knowing I can get work done just about anywhere.

Otherwise, a slight learning curve will be necessary to get used to it, but for 80+ percent of what I do on a laptop, it's perfect.  Small and easy to tote around.Be advised the processor is not world class, nor is the video display - watching movies or other videos on a tablet is nicer, but the cost versus the function makes it a great deal.

775,"I did a lot of browsing before committing to buy the Samsung Google Chromebook. Mainly, I considered buying a refurbished laptop; however, I found if I wanted newer laptop I had to settle for an older version of Microsoft or if I considered a new version of Microsoft, I had to settle for an older version PC. Both exceeded the cost of the Chromebook. The Chromebook is loaded with apps and other features, so many I don't even know where to start. I do use Google docs quite a bit, it did take some use to getting to as I have to realize that the word processing or it's ""office suite"" so to speak is not like Microsoft. Nevertheless, in my opinion is more user friendly once you figure out how to navigate. Basically, you get exactly what you need to put out results. I love the size of the Chromebook, the close proximity of the keyboard keys, and the ease of transitioning from apps, Google Drive to the internet. No regrets here, even though I am still learning. I certainly believe I got the most bang for my buck. I even bought a skin for my  Chromebook! Even with all the reviews I read, I still did my research and ended up committing to this product. No regrets!

780,"I purchased two of these for use in an 8th grade classroom.  The kids prefer these to the other devices in the room (standard Windows desktops and laptops), and that's a good sign.  They are using Khan Academy, and everything works fine.Pro: they are light, compact, and inexpensive.  They boot quickly.Con: the configuration options, if you must use them, are not great.  For example, I tried a new router in the classroom, and wasn't able to connect the Chromebooks to it.  There just wasn't enough information (at least where I could find it) to tell what was wrong.  I tried more than one set of security options on the router, with no improvement.  Windows computers and Android phones were connecting easily.  I went back to the original router.Battery life is a little confusing.  As advertised, you can use one of these for a long time on one battery charge.  On the other hand, it seems to discharge quickly in storage.  I think it  has something to do with how you shut it down, but it isn't obvious.  It should probably default to a full shutdown when you close the lid, or have some way of detecting when it is discharging while doing nothing.It is also odd to have a device which is so internet (and Google) dependent.  It wouldn't even let me try the thing out until I used a Google login.  Hi, big brother!

782,"This would be GREAT if the keyboard was in upper case.  Lower case is much harder to differentiate which keys you want in low light. I mostly use this little laptop when on the couch or in bed.  On other laptops I can type without looking at the keyboard, but this one is slightly ""off center"" from what I am used to so I often need to stop and ""look"" for a key.There isn't an All Caps key, or a Delete key.  No way to do a Control/Alt/Delete when it freezes.  No way to do a virus scan.. it's supposedly built in, but I don't like not being able to activate it myself when needed.  The touchpad is also a problem, no right click.  The spell check is automatic while you type, but doesn't have a spell check at the top, just underlines misspelled words.  The touchpad used to cause things to jump around when you touch it or even hover over it, but that seems to have resolved itself with updates.  There isn't any way you can request updates, they just occasionally show up and ask you to reboot, which is another problem, there is no easy ""reboot"", you need to turn the computer off manually and turn it back on.All in all, it is a good little laptop, but there are things that have become very annoying.The video has not worked from the start.  It has a direct link to YouTube, but you cannot watch a video for more than a few seconds at a time.  A serious problem.  Reading other reviews I see this has been a problem for many, but not all users.UPDATE:This little computer was a thrill at first because it loaded pages so fast.. no longer the case.  It's behaving just like my much more expensive laptop which started taking forever to load pages, after 3 years.  Now this little guy is doing the same, after only 5 months.  Very annoying!Another thing that I was shocked about is I get emails asking me how I dealt with problems.. to assist other customers.  NOT MY JOB!  Very annoying that they would presume upon a customer in that manner.  They seem to have assumed that I solved the problems, but that isn't the case, I still can't watch videos, which is a major disappointment.  If they're going to write to me, they should be offering to help me, not ask me to help other people.All that said, I am considering replacing this failing little guy with a new one, you can't beat the price... but it should have lasted a lot longer than 5 months!

This computer has exceeded all expectations. It's incredibly fast, has a wonderful keyboard, and has been able to fill every one of my computer needs. For those of you who are less tech-savvy, it is fairly straightforward to use, although there are some tips and tricks that are worth learning.Samsung does themselves a disservice with their claim of the battery life. I have gotten well over *fourteen hours* of battery life on my computer on many occasions.Google updates their software frequently, and many of the issues that were present just a month ago when I purchased it (such as the lack of Netflix streaming) have been fixed. So even if there's a minor software thing that you might be worried about - I wouldn't be surprised if it was fixed in the next few months.This is a wonderful computer at the right price. I wouldn't want it to be my only computer - it is certainly nice having the full capacity of a primary computer.

785,"I bought the Chromebook for the wife.  She always dreads when I install a new or updated Linux distribution on her laptop. Since she mostly just surfs the web, I figured that once she mastered the Chrome browser (we normally use Firefox or Iceweasel), she would find its operation simple enough to not cause panic, and relieve me any software maintenance duties.With a few tweaks to the standard setup, within a week, she was happily surfing away and no longer needed my help.  The battery lasts for hours.  Startup is nearly instantaneous.  Ever so often, the system will download the updates, and with a quick reboot, the Chromebook is up-to-date.  It is all very uneventful.She finds the keyboard comfortable and easy to use.  Since she prefers a mouse to the trackpad, I just installed the nano-receiver from a M305 wireless mouse, and the system instantly recognized it.My only complaint with the Chromebook is the reliance on Google's cloudprint service for printing.  I would have much preferred to see the system use CUPS printing as is typical for most Linux or Unix based computers.  Other than this one issue, I am very pleased with the product.

My only issue is that i wish it had 4 GB of ram instead of 2 GB because sometimes i go tab crazy or i find myself on a media site that is really heavy and trying to load lots of things... this can really slow things down despite a fast internet connection.

789,"I bought this after not wanting to lug my 15"" laptop to a 4-day conference, and so I took rather illegible hand-written notes instead. I noticed that many in the group were using netbooks or ultrabooks for this purpose.Since I have a work desktop, a home desktop and a full-sized laptop, I did not want to spend money on a substandard netbook that tries to be a full fledged computer but can't; or an ultrabook that is a full-fledged computer but costs $1000 or thereabout, and with tradeoffs of its own (despite being expensive, substandard graphics capability, for example).I noticed a guy who sat next to me had a Chromebook and he had it unplugged, and on all day at the seminar.  He closed the lid at breaks, opened the lid and continued typing.  The battery seemed to last all day, no problem. One of the days was a 10 hour days and he never plugged in.  That caught my attention.So, I researched the new Samsung Chromebook.  It seems like exactly what I needed -- folded, the size, weight and thickness of a tablet, but with a full keyboard that was reasonable to type on. I could carry it around by itself, or zipped in a portfolio, or in a briefcase or messenger bag and not even notice it. The extreme portability means I can type anywhere, the battery lasts longer than any other laptop. The boot time is a few seconds, the wake up time is maybe 2 seconds.Think ""tablet-sized office productivity computer"" and if that fits your need, I'd recommend it. Great for taking notes, writing a book, surfing the web, watching video, whatever.Here are some things to note:1.  You can still write and use some apps ""offline"" but the wifi version of this requires connection to the net via a WiFi network. You save stuff on Googledrive -  like Google's version of Dropbox.  You DO NOT have a massive internal Hard Drive in this machine.2.  This is not for video or audio editing, or 3D video games (but there are lots of casual and browser-based games and productivity apps like what you'd find in a tablet computer.)3.  YouTube and Amazon Streaming work fine, as do a number of other video sites, but NetFlix hasn't perfected its plug-in for it, yet, but they have promised to do so.  If you can stream video on an iPhone and Google Tablet, it should be just a matter of time before they iron out whatever the wrinkle is.4.  This thing is very light, seems well-constructed, but the screen is not best-in-class and not as good as screens found on tablet computers. It is not a great screen, and does not have a great viewing angle, but it is ""good enough"" for productivity, light casual games and casual web viewing.  There is zero chance you will confuse this with an Apple Retina Display.After charging the battery fully, I set the computer up and tested Youtube, Google docs, Amazon streaming, and various other websites like Facebook. The keyboard is comfortable (I am a guy with guy hands and I had no problem typing).  No problems, no hangups, and I played probably 3 hours of video in addition to multi-tab web surfing and it lasted more than 6 hours. At about 6 hours and 10 minutes, I had to go to bed and I still had a 10% charge, so 6 to 7 hours of battery life seems reasonable.If you are expecting a full-fledged multi-use Windows machine, don't buy it.  If you want a school machine or a portable work machine for note taking and writing and being productive wherever you happen to be, I have to say, Samsung seems to have a real winner on their hands. The price and size are right.UpdateI notice that the battery life on use is still fantastic. I note that it does not charge a fast as an Apple tablet, and that at rest/not being used, the battery discharges after several days. By way of comparison, my Apple Tablet lasts months with no use and still maintains some charge.  Minor quibble.  This is still, in my estimation, a fantastic purchase.

791,"I've been using the Chromebook for about 6 months now.  I like that it is lightweight and boots up quickly.  The trackpad and the keyboard also work well.Beyond that, however, it offers more frustration than enjoyment.  This is largely due to Chrome OS rather than the hardware.  When I purchased the laptop, I thought that Chrome OS would be continually refined and polished.  After all, it was developed by Google.That hasn't really been the case.  This is particularly apparent when it comes to watching streaming video over the internet.  Only very recently has it become possible to watch videos from Netflix, and that was because of changes that Netflix made.  There is little codec support in Chrome OS, and recent patches to the OS seem to have actually degraded the Chromebook's capability to watch things like YouTube videos.  There are frequent hangs, stutters, crashes, etc. even with no browser extensions loaded.Also, to prevent the Chromebook from going to sleep while doing something like streaming music, you have to download a third-party extension.  Chrome OS doesn't even let you change the power management features without a workaround.  This is inexcusable and says to me that there really isn't much interest in improving it.In short, I would say skip this product until Google decides to dedicate some resources to making Chrome OS better than it currently is.

Ultimately, I couldn't justify the cost and figured I would try out a low-end Chromebook first.First of all, I should clarify that this is my ""second computer."" I won't call it a backup, because often it's my go-to computer, but I could not survive with it being my *only* computer.That said, I love being able to open it up at a cafe and be on the Internet in seconds. I use Google Docs for my word processing needs and most of my life is in the cloud, so for most stuff, the Chromebook is perfect.Some good stuff....It ""feels"" like a $250 computer at times, but that's not entirely a bad thing. It's very lightweight and easy to carry. It doesn't ever get warm. The ease of accessing the Internet is superb. The connection speed seems comparable to any other laptop on a connection with similar speed. I would caution if you typically keep 10-12 tabs open at the same time, there may be a little lag as you click on one you haven't visited in a while. The price can't be beat. There's a certain security in knowing that I could lose or break my Chromebook and not only would I not lose any data, but I could get a new one for such a low price.Some bad stuff...I really wish it had a longer lasting battery. My traditional laptop has a much stronger battery life. The sound just doesn't seem as robust as I would like it. If you are an audiophile, you might want to play with one first to see if it meets your needs.Bottom line...If you are aware of the Chromebook's limitations and this type of device fits your needs, go for it.

In a second step, drag and drop them to your Google drive (Cloud) to be available for Google environment.Cloud computing is required (almost mandatory) to use your Chromebook.

Not sure why exactly, but this Chromebook tends to have fewer update reboots or failures than I've experienced with other devices.  No loud harddrive... I like that!  It doesn't get hot.  It's comfy on my lap.  It boots in SECONDS!  That part is impressive!I might event get the boys their own Chromebooks!

810,"My wife just bought a Windows 8 laptop, and it is a nightmare. Virtually every update screws something up. That's just one reason I love my Samsung Chromebook. It's not Windows. It takes no time to load; just open the top and its ready to go. It's light and very portable. The keyboard is fantastic. The apps are good. The updates, unlike Windows, are invisible to me and don't cause any problems.I have only two minor complaints, neither of which is serious enough to knock my rating down to four stars. First, the screen resolution, compared to my Dell desktop and my Kindle Fire, is not that great. Second, occasionally, I can't access any online service, Google, for example. When that happens, I have to shut down and restart. It's a minor annoyance.Overall, for the price, you can't beat this neat little product

815,"I've owned this Samsung model for a couple of months now, and it has slowly worked its way into becoming my primary machine for most daily tasks.Much like a Mac/OSX environment, any given Chromebook is just plain going to work. ChromeOS has its limitations -- covered in these reviews and elsewhere -- but for what Chromebooks are, in terms of a very basic productivity/web browsing experience, this Samsung Chromebook does a very admirable job at a very respectable price.For the rest of this review, I simply wish to focus on one thing: what keeps this from being a 5-star machine?* SCREEN: While more than adequate for the given resolution, we live in an era where screens on laptops count a great deal. Apple gets this, but other manufacturers just aren't there yet. Granted, mediocre displays keep cost down, which was a primary factor for Samsung in creating this Chromebook. Still, we need higher resolution and a greater pixel density in this Samsung line before we can call this size-factor truly .* RAM & PROCESSOR: Though I've not seen it benchmarked, I'd predict that the ARM is fantastic here. The problem is that these machines simply do not carry enough RAM, and this has an overall affect on page rendering times. Even basic extensions, like the new Google Hangouts, are unwieldy and run with slight delay.When Samsung can fix these two factors and give us just slightly better hardware in a future model, this machine will become an indispensable one in the lives of geeks and regular users alike. Until then, one still can't go wrong with this system as a secondary or tertiary computing device for content consumption AND creation. That said, I would rank its utility above most tablets at this current time.

816,"I needed a new computer but am on a limited budget. I didn't need some over-the-top, high powered fancy computer, just something to serve my basic needs - word processing, spreadsheets, emails, games, videos. I saw the Chromebook advertised on TV and asked my son (much more of a computer geek than I am) to look into it. Everything he had to say was good, so I saved up my gift cards for my birthday and Christmas and bought one and I couldn't be happier. With the exception of a tempermental  Flash player and some streaming video (from Netflix in particular which I am told will be coming soon) not available, this little baby is terrific!!! Just what I needed!

817,"I bought this after reading several reports and product reviews, not to mention that a collaboration between Samsung and Google couldn't be a bad thing. Pros: The Chromebook is lightweight, and made fairly well, although I do have a couple of minor complaints that I will describe in the Cons section.  I like how quickly it boots up and how the OS self updates.  I am on and off the laptop throughout the day but only need to recharge it once per day, usually.  It is simple to use and seems to be fairly intuitive.  I like the auto backup feature when working on docs and emails.Cons: I think that the casing could be sealed a little better at the corners of the monitor lid.  It could be just my laptop but the case seems like it could be manufactured to be a little more durable, considering it's manufactured by Samsung.All in all,  I think this was a great purchase for me at it's price.  I cannot use it for work due too a few limitations, but this review is not intended to focus on that.  This is strictly a review of how well I like it for a home, personal laptop where the user doesn't need a lot of horsepower.Thumbs up...

818,"Solid construction, well designed. Very fast on either wi-fi or 3g.  OS updates automatically over the air.  You don't have to do anything.  No need to update software, install virus protection, etc.  Again that is all handled automatically at no additional cost. Caution to prospective purchasers. This computer has very little internal memory so if you like to store a lot of photos, videos, files etc locally is not for you.  If you are comfortable with cloud storage then go for it. That said they are issuing some apps for offline use.

819,"The Samsung Chromebook is great, for what it is. What it's not is a full-powered laptop. What it is: a word-processing, internet browsing, video watching machine. The Chromebook has really bridged the gap between my phone/tablet and my full-powered PC laptop. I don't need to be able to play games on this. All I want to be able to do is write and post to my blog from the comfort of my couch or back porch. I want to be able to take my writings with me so I can work at someone else's house. I can even still write if I am without internet connection. It will auto-upload later whatever work I have done. I am already in the Google ecosystem. All my docs are already on Drive and all my TV shows and movies and music on Play. It's a no-brainer for me. If the rumor about running android apps is true, this device will become even more powerful.So, don't be fooled, this is great for exactly what it is. If you need a full-laptop, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a word-processing internet browsing machine to bridge that gap, this is perfect.

826,"I am someone who will be in college soon and I wanted to find a cheap laptop to use once I start school.  I have just recently made a custom built windows PC, so I did not want an expensive laptop.  My plan is to have my PC with me at college and bring a laptop as well for when I am walking around campus.  The Chromebook caught my interest with having exactly what I needed and at an amazing price.HARDWARE  This laptop is extremely light.  The fact that this is made of plastic helps this.  I have no problems walking around with this and it makes my mom's laptop feel like a brick.  I will appreciate this lightness a lot when walking around campus to all of my classes.  The keyboard has to be one of the best keyboards that I have ever used.  I am not a huge Apple fan, but I have used their keyboards and I have always thought that the keyboards on their MacBooks were really nice.  This keyboard is very identical to an Apple keyboard and it is amazing to type on.  My biggest complaint about this keyboard is that there is not a caps lock button, but it is not a huge issue for me.  I am typing on it to write this review!  I don't see many people talk much about the trackpad on this thing, which was important for me when deciding on buying a laptop.  Something else I really enjoyed about MacBooks was their really nice trackpad and how great it was to navigate with it, though the price of a MacBook is the reason I will probably never own one.  The trackpad on the Chromebook is not as nice as an Apple trackpad, but it is still a pretty good trackpad.  You can scroll using two fingers, but that's about it.  There are not many gestures on this trackpad and the one I am missing the most is being able to swipe my hand across it to go back a page.  It's not a needed feature, so the back buttons on the keyboard will be fine.  The screen is not the greatest thing ever, but for the price it is very nice.  Personally I think the screen should be slightly taller but it could just be because I'm used to bigger screens.  I do not own a 3.0 USB flash drive or plan to use the HDMI output on this device, though it is nice knowing that these features are there.  The Chromebook also stays pretty cool.  The only time I notice it getting really warm is anytime I plug the charger in, but besides that it stays pretty cool.  I have not tested the battery life too much, but at 86% battery left, it says that I have about 5 hours and 26 minutes left, which is pretty good in my opinion.  I can't say much about the speakers either, they are average speakers and they are good enough for me.  I probably won't be using the speakers too much and will be using headphones instead.SOFTWARE  What makes this laptop really cool is the Chrome OS.  It is a very minimalist operating system, and I think it is perfect for anyone who only gets on the internet and writes documents.  Yes you can not do much on this device if you are not connecting online, but most people don't realize that they are connected to the Internet almost all the time, and it is not as big of an issue as many people think it is.  I am also already a big user of Google's apps so not much is foreign to me.  Pretty much what you get is the Google Chrome browser.  I already use Google Chrome as my default browser so everything was familiar with me.  For many people, just getting onto the internet is all that they do.  For me it is the majority that I do minus a few powerful programs and a little bit of gaming.  Since I used Google Chrome on my desktop, everything I have was synced onto my Chromebook the second I got on, from bookmarks to extensions.  It was painless and was like I never left my desktop.  Many people would be surprised at what sort of apps they have in the chrome web store.  There are also many online websites and applications that you can find that can replace some desktop apps that you didn't know had a replacement.  The actual browsing experience is good.  It feels just as good as browsing on a desktop and I do not have any major loading times.  If you scroll through a webpage fast enough you can see the checkered board pattern that you see on slower devices, but I did not find it as a major issue.  Those that use Microsoft Office will find that with the new Office requiring a yearly subscription to use, now is one of the best times to switch to Google Docs.  Google Docs is Google's own version of an Office suite.  They have their own versions of Word,  Excel, and Powerpoint.  These have replaced Microsoft Office for me and I have no regrets with switching.  The best part about using Google Docs is that every edit you make gets saved automatically and it is automatically synced to all of your devices.  You never have to worry about losing your data or progress when you have to type up an essay or important presentation.  This is the biggest selling point for getting a Chromebook as a student.  I don't need a MacBook to use Office when I can have a Chromebook with Google Docs.  Those with a large iTunes library will love using Google Music.  Google Music syncs to iTunes from a PC or Mac and uploads all of your songs onto the cloud, and it can be accessed with any computer, including your Chromebook.  This is what makes the Chromebook a great secondary device.  I use iTunes on my Desktop to keep all of my songs organized, and Google Play automatically syncs my songs to their service.  I don't have to download the songs onto my Chromebook to listen to them, I can just log on and play.  You can not get Photoshop on a Chromebook, and it is the main reason I will not use a Chromebook as my primary device.  There are a few replacements out there for some smaller editing though there are not as great as using Photoshop in my opinion.  This is what makes it a secondary device for me.  I will use the Chromebook for traveling, typing, and browsing the internet and I will use my desktop for gaming and using Windows applications like Photoshop.  With Google Drive you get 100gb of cloud storage for two years.  This alone almost pays for the Chromebook, honestly I am not sure if I will use all of it as I will be using my desktop mostly for storage, extra storage will never hurt though.CONCLUSION  The fact that this thing is $250 makes it worth getting alone.  It is not the most powerful device on the market,  but it is easily the biggest bang for your buck.  If all you ever do on your device is browse the web, watch videos, or write documents, this is without a doubt the device for you.  If gaming or programs like Photoshop are important to you like it is for me, then consider getting this as a secondary device.  Google Docs makes a great office replacement, and I know that it will be useful for me when I take notes and write papers in college.  The best part is that the documents will not be lost if my Chromebook dies or it gets stolen, as it automatically saves and is saved to all of my devices.  I can't recommend this enough for anyone that wants a really cheap device for school.

828,"I got this chromebook to use as a backup accompaniment playback device because it was touted as booting up in less than 10 seconds. Yeh, it does. But, as a low vision user, I have a massive complaint. For one, Google should stop letting people under the age of 50 design their interface. The mouse is impossible to see, or find it's so small. You CAN NOT adjust the size of the mouse pointer.However, the Chrome OS does have a screen magnifier, but the mouse does not get magnified along with the rest of the interface.There is a screen reader built in.At first boot up, the OS at least provided the ability to turn on the magnifier, text to speach, or high contrast. However, once the initial stuff was taken care of, it went right back to factory default scheme. I had to go back into settings, and find the accessibility settings in advanced settins in order to get it back to useful settings for low vision users. At least it's set now, and my low vision settings remain intact on reboots.I really wish the mouse pointer could be enlarged.The system is very sluggish for all it's power under the hood. Just after updating, everything went south. The mouse quit responding, and disappeared everytime I went to move it. Strangely, after half a dozen reboots, most of the sluggishness went away, but it's still sluggish.I don't like the media player. When I tried to play my accompaniment files, the player ketp right on blundering forth, playing the next track without stopping after the first. Not good.Oh, as a technician, I really was let down by the fact this computer comes with only wi-fi and or 3G, but no physical ethernet port. I had to order a usb to ethernet adaptor.I also don't like that the SD card slot only allows partial insertion of the card.Next up on the gripe list, Yeh, presenters won't like this one. Does NOT come with a USB to HDMI or VGA cable. You have to order that too. Furthermore, you can't see your screen when you run video to a monitor. Oh that just makes you look so smart when you go to present at a board meeting, don't it. Yeh, right! So now you have to turn around with your back to the audience so you can see the big monitor. Not a good way to present. Nope. Not good at all. Google, needs to fix that. We really need multi-monitor output.Did I mention that mouse is so tiny, you can't see it very easily?What's to like? I DO like the larger, and nicely spaced keys. Makes it easy for low vision users to use the keyboard.Would have been nice if some of the standard key conventions had been carried over into Chromebook.I'll update this review if Google ever gives us control over mouse pointer size, and control over how the media player operates.UPDATE: Not the update I was hoping to add, but I've noticed that when the power adaptor is disconnected, the system seems to work fine, a bit sluggish, but ok. When the power is connected again, the mouse function goes in and out, and becomes useless until the power is disconnected again. don't know what's up with that.UPDATE: Working on a hunch, I grabbed a standard desktop mouse, and connected it to a USB port on the Chromebook. Once done, all functionality was restored, even with the power addaptor connected. All, that is, except for the touchpad, which remained useless unti the power connecttor was removed again. SOOOooo,,, If your machine does this hinky little behavior, make sure to pack a mouse along when traveling just in case. Still, I'm a good bit miffed at Google, and Samsung for this.UPDATE: Copying files and folders to the Google Drive from your local drive is a hit and miss affair. It's like trying to move sand from a full buckeet, to an empty bucket using only your fingers. Most of the files you try to paste into your Google drive won't make it. So you have to do it in small chunks at a time I guess. Not good. I had about a dozen folders, each with a dozen, or more files in them which needed to go to the Google drive, but once the tranfer completed, I went in, and discovered that most of the data never even made it over. Only the folders, and maybe one or two files made it into each folder. NOT HAPPY. Makes me wonder if my data will even make it down intact when I need it.

If you need some kind of program or function or other that you can't use without a Chromebook, don't buy this! I only bought it because I knew I would only use it for school and Netflix, and I didn't want to lug an 8-lb computer around all day.It does what it says very well, haven't had any problems with it after 6ish months.

This is supposed to be a device that completely/solely works off one's internet -- and yet it has internet connectivity defectiveness?

Does that mean that you're not supposed to type anything at all? What a crock.

You do not need a kindle with this, chrome has the kindle app.  I have purchased a total of 3 chromebooks, one for myself and the other 2 for family. Google docs are great, kids need me to edit I can hop right on and do so.  I plan on purchasing another one for my mother that how simple and user friendly they are.  You are able to add your flash drive and a port to charge others things, like your cell phone.  The samsung has great quality, nice screen.

842,"I love Google products and had been itching to get a Chromebook for a long time. Even though they are relatively cheap compared to full-fledged laptops, given the minimal abilities of Chrome OS, I wasn't willing to buy a Chromebook until this sale came long. The price was great, and I received the product without delay and boy was it beautiful. Slim, light, well designed. The build quality wasn't the greatest, but it was a $250 retail product, so I wasn't expecting much.But then I turned it on and opened up a few tabs as I normally would on my regular Macbook Pro -- nothing too computationally intensive, just Gmail, Facebook, and ESPN...before I knew it, the computer was STRUGGLING. I couldn't switch between those three tabs without lag. They say Chromebooks are meant for light usage and web browsing, but I don't know ANYONE who ever only has one tab open on a browser at one time, and it seems like that's all this Samsung Chromebook can handle with the processor it has. If you like to switch quickly between tabs or stream music while doing emails or reading the news, this Samsung Chromebook is NOT for you -- I don't think its a product of the Chrome OS necessarily, so maybe look for a more powerful Chromebook.All in all, this Chromebook is all beauty but no brains - web surfers, emailers, news readers, music listeners, look somewhere else for a light, cheap alternative...there are PLENTY out there, whether they are another type of Chromebook or a Windows laptop.

843,"My first few days were spent in total agony - I was so frustrated with trying to figure the right apps to use for all the programs I would normally either have or could easily install later.  There's such an abundant amount of apps for each program that it's hard to figure which one will work best.  But once you get through all the frustration of that initial stage, it's an absolute breeze.  I wouldn't want to go back to a ""normal"" computer; they're a headache now.  Chromebook has simplified everything.  Yay for Chromebook!

844,"I remember seeing the release of the first gen Chromebooks a few months ago, and they really piqued my interest. At the time, I did not have enough money to purchase one, so I decided to wait. Once again, waiting paid off. When I saw the commercial for the new Samsung Chromebook, and that it was only $249, I knew it was what I've been looking for.I waited almost four weeks to receive my new Samsung Chromebook. It was definitely worth the wait! I'm a sophomore in college taking multiple online courses, and I needed something light and portable for those typical college student coffee house trips. I have a Motorola XOOM wifi tablet that I love to death, but it just wasn't cutting it. I have a three year old HP G-series laptop that I have been wanting to replace for about six months. Its battery only lasts 10 minutes, rendering it almost completely useless when it comes to mobility. I almost got another Windows computer, but I am so glad I didn't.This computer is extremely lightweight. What a difference between it and my old HP. I love the fact that there is no fan, making this the quietest computer I've ever encountered. Startup is lightning fast. It takes maybe 8 seconds to turn on, and about 3 seconds to wake up from sleep mode. The small 16GB hard drive kind of worried me at first, but the included free 100GB  of storage on Google Drive definitely makes up for the lack of built in storage. The build quality is excellent in comparison to its price. The keyboard is firm, and the trackpad somewhat reminds me of those on a MacBook. The auto dimming feature is pretty cool, although it can become aggravating. I would have to say that my favorite app so far is the Chrome Remote Desktop Beta app. It's basically like having all the data from my old HP put onto this sleek new Samsung device.I will say that at first I was skeptical about how useful this laptop would be, but after a day's use discovering all the cool features and tricks this little Samsung has rolled up its sleeve, I can now see that this is probably the smartest buy I've made all year.

It slips into my purse, It gets carried around, it plays pandora when I clean and amuses me while my daughter takes dance.  I have downloaded free educational apps for her, and some more fun ones got me, but what this DOES is it lets me check my email and share documents and write anywhere basically.  It powers up so quickly and connects so fast, in the time it takes to get a coffee made at starbucks I can make sure I'm not missing anything.I read about the battery life and I thought -- no way.  But it's true, I get this insane amount of time off one charge.  It's perfect for taking with without hauling something heavy.  I use it, my daughter uses it, it goes everywhere, but the best thing, it doesn't get hot.  She can curl up with it under a blanket on the couch and spend time at the educational games on her school's web site.  I'm surprised the the speakers don't suck, and the screen is perfectly fine.  Sure, it's not a 'wow best speakers ever' or 'the screen is amazing' but for a little, portable, lightweight piece of awesome, both are so much better than I anticipated.  I love this little thing.

853,"I bought four of these for four girls, ages 12-16. They are mostly used for video chatting, watching videos, and doing Khan Academy exercises (in addition to general-purpose web browsing, of course).The Chromebooks are easy to use, and it's very convenient that they're tied to their google accounts - any girl can log in on any Chromebook and still see their own bookmarks, Google Docs, etc.Setup was trivially easy, and I liked that I could ""power wash"" them to reset them to factory condition before handing them out.Battery life is good. 6-8 hours of use from a single charge, at least initially.The non-standard keyboards took some getting used to, but are a good decision in hindsight (removing seldom-used function keys, instead replacing them with brightness/volume/etc).I would not buy one for myself, unless I was going to dual-boot with Ubuntu. There are a few things I need to do daily that can't be done in a web browser.Edit: After almost a year, one of these has a broken charging jack, and another has a smashed screen from a one meter drop. Although the Chrome OS is still going strong, I probably would not buy this model again. Accordingly, I have reduced my initial five-star review to three.

I use my chromebook to view notes that professors post as well as to take notes of my own in google docs.  I also use it for web assignments and to browse the internet.  I have personally used multiple computers running windows as well as macbooks and this is by far the best computer I have had for these purposes so far.  Although it is not a very customizable/powerful computer it gets the job done for these purposes.  I can shut my computer down in between every class because the boot time for me is less than 7 seconds!  It took me about an hour to get used to google docs and after that I was in love with it.The computer is so fast and the hardware (keyboard, ports, touchpad, etc) are also excellent.  The touchpad is every bit as good as an apple touchpad and the keyboard is nearly there.  Although the screen is small, I love it because the computer fits on my desk easily in class and I can also have a notebook or notes packet along with it  After using this product for about a week, I could not be happier and could not think of anything that I did not like about it.Also, I find that I regularly get 7 hours of battery life taking notes, browsing, etc.Like the title says, best electronic purchase of the year - and its cheap!  Also, Amazon and google both have great customer service that have helped me with my chromebook.  My advice is that if you only browse the internet and mildly use ""word"" and ""excel"" documents, there is no reason to blow $1000 on a mac when you can do the same things on here - only faster!

For those looking for a computer replacement look elsewhere if you rely on typical Windows/OS X applications. Most people (myself included) really only use the browser and can rely on web apps for light spreadsheet and word processing. This machine does that very well, for the right price.

866,"Trust me, I had my worries about the ability of this computer. Coming from a history of under-performing laptops it was a bit of a gamble to jump to the new Samsung Chromebook.In short: A great decision.The machine is a little powerhouse. Of course you must know exactly what you are getting into prior to purchase; that is essentially a OS version of Google Chrome as others have mentioned. But if you are anything like me (ie. Use google products such as gmail, google docs, etc. and mostly internet consumption) which lets be honest, is most people, then this little laptop is for you.It is not blazing fast but it gets the job done and doesnt leave you wondering where the content is. Mind you, I'm coming from a desktop with an i7 - 920 quad core overclocked to 3.7ghz with 6gb ram so I know what decent speed is. All in all I am very impressed with the performance as well as the sleek design.There are a few negatives as mentioned in other reviews. Mainly for me, the screen. Another reviewer captured it nicely in that it leaves a bit to be desired. Not a deal breaker. Other minor issues include a bit of backlight bleed on edges of screen, low sound levels, a bit of push on handrest, and the power key light is visible underneath the key when lying down.It may sound like I'm being critical but those issues are incredibly minor in this whole package. This is a product that is a great buy with tremendous value. I was going to purchase a new top of the line macbook air until I saw this guy. Wow am I glad I didn't. I re-evaluated my needs and am VERY pleased with the results.An awesome product from google.

If you have lots of music files that exceed 100G, then you'll have to pick and choose. The music service also can't manage wav files. Really, no wavs?It isn't compatible with MS Office, so no word, powerpoint, or excel. Of course, google has versions of all of these programs, but they're markedle inferior to the MS stuff. And let's face it, for work applications MS is the standard and the google apps are some weird freebie sub-standard.Bottom line:Buy this for surfing, but don't expect it to replace a full-fledged laptop.

I'm big on recording and gaming, and this laptop absolutely isn't for that. The battery life is good, but if you leave the laptop to get too hot, then it has a knack for randomly freezing up and cutting off.

886,"This thing is small, light, and absurdly fast.If you want a full-featured Linux desktop (including local software) you can enable developer mode and run the Crouton script--it seems like it would be difficult, but trust me, it's easy and you wind up with a full OS (with a word processor, and image editing, and all that stuff that you usually expect from an OS) instead of just the Chrome OS. That said, I split my time between both, as both are pretty good experiences.Battery life is 6.5-8 hours on a 2-cell battery--wish they'd sacrificed some weight to give it a 4-cell for a 12-14 hour life though. Maybe I'm the only one who'd make that trade, but I'd do it in a heartbeat. Still, this is good enough to spend all day out and about without having to bother with bringing your charger, provided you've got a lunchbreak.The screen has terrible contrast but does the trick.It's incredibly thin and my wife occasionally gets it mixed up with her Macbook Air (not for long as this is plasticy instead of aluminum).Closing to sleep is instant and waking up is so fast it almost makes you worry that it never went to sleep in the first place. Even the card reconnects to the router quickly.This is exactly what netbooks were supposed to be but never were. It's my single favorite computer purchase ever by a longshot. I'd buy it again any day.

887,"After a little over a week of the chromebook use, we are very happy with it. The battery lasts more than 6 to 7 hours. The keypad is easy to use. It is very lightweight and does not get hot on your lap while using it. We do not use it for gaming, just email, browsing research and youtube videos. The only bad thing is that it currently does not support Netflix. Something is in the works to get it up to date, though.

891,"This is everything that I could ever want and need in a computer. Let me start out by saying that the keyboard, the touch pad, and the battery life are simply amazing. It's such a pleasure to type on this thing, the touch pad is so responsive and the battery life will blow you away; when it's time to charge it, just a simple hour charge, and you're good to go for the rest of the day. I love the sleep function, and the fact that everything is save on the cloud, because if someone were to steal it, it I wouldn't lose any of my documents, just a really good computer. For surfing the web, doing research, and keeping in touch with friends via social media, there is nothing out there that will do what this will for the price. I would highly recommend getting the iPearl hard shell case for the Chromebook, because that way people won't be able to tell that it's a Chromebook; it' looks just like a MacBook Air, which is great. Anyways, it's  great computer for what I use it for. If you want to play games and do all sorts of photo editing, look elsewhere; however, for surfing the internet, researching, movies, and social media, you simply can't beat it for the price.

Apparently, I'm not the only one who has issues with this.  At this point, the options are 1) wait for an update (Samsung can't tell me whether it is a hardware or software issue) or 2) send it back to them.  I don't have time for that.  It is amazing to me that they can't tell simply tell what the problem is because so many others have it.It will also not stream Netflix.  This is not that big of a deal to me.

Got tired of dragging around a laptop, and took the risk for $249. Tried but disliked due to its poor display my friend's Acer Chromebook--too hard to read in broad daylight.  I wasn't expecting too much for the price, but am VERY pleasantly surprised.  This is quick, reliable, and has a very decent display for web surfing.  I'm also able to open (in Read-Only) powerpoints and word docs from my corporate server.  I'm looking forward to taking this baby on a European trip because its so light, and hey - who cares if I drop it and it busts?  I did drop it - hard - and it didn't bust, though, so I'm more than pleased with this device.  When your kid bugs you for an Apple for goofing off on the internet, get this instead and use the rest of the money to go away for a nice weekend.

I like the Chrome setup from what I can tell it is a great easy to use simple laptop.Sadly, the WiFi card is not working properly.  After 3 reboots I was able to get it to hold a connection for 2 minutes.  I have a Macbook next to it on the same network without issue.  It no longer even sees the networks for my entire neighborhood.  I can see at least 8 networks on other computers at all times.So I contacted Samsung.  They told me it must be the network and that maybe it's not compatible with the network.  I explained it can not see any networks not just my network.  They then told me to power cycle it...amazing advice, never thought to do that. This epic in depth tech support continued until I lost my patience and returned the computer to Amazon.I honestly really wish it would have worked.  The size and feel of the product was great, the quality not so much. Samsung Tech Support was the final nail in this things coffin.  They were horrible!

901,"I've had my Chromebook for about 5 months now.  I originally bought it to take on an extended summer vacation.  I needed a way to pay bills and keep up with email and family while on a 6 week trip.  I didn't want an expensive full blown computer with a power hungry hard drive and an OS that needed virus protection and constant updates.  I was a bit concerned with some of the reports of problems on this site, but decided that for $250, I'd take my chances.  The little Samsung performed perfectly. It survived a month and a half of camping quite well.  Whenever I came across a WiFi connection, it booted up within a few seconds and I was in business. Since I rarely used it for more than an hour at a time, I only needed to charge it about once a week.  It really runs 6 - 6.5 hrs. on a charge.  I even learned to video chat with friends and make phone calls through Google's free service (can't beat the price!).  While this will never replace my 'real' computer, it has everything and can do everything that a traveling computer should do.  It also doesn't have many things that are not needed.  Heavy drive to hold big OS, heavy battery to power heavy drive, fans to cool all that heavy equipment...  It's actually more like a smartphone with an great screen and excellent keyboard.  There are Google apps to perform most common computer functions in the cloud.  I plugged in a 32G SD card for extra local storage, but I haven't needed it.  I'm happy to report that I have not had any of the freezing or rebooting issues that some have complained about.  Since returning from my trip I've been using the 'book for Internet access at home, instead of firing up the desktop.  I also hook it up (via the HDMI port) to my TV to watch movies and TV shows on Netflix, Hulu, and Viewster.  Works great, especially for Hulu, which has some shows that are only available to computer browsers (i.e. not to TVs or mobile devices).  Overall, the little Samsung exceeded my expectations.  I never expected it to edit video or do high end gaming, but as it turns out, it does quite a bit more than I thought it could.  BTW, my coworker checked my 'book out right after I bought it.  He has since bought two of them and is very happy with them.

It has 2 usb ports so I can download my photos, and there is a built in editing program... not fancy, but you can do all you want to do when traveling. Like sorting, cropping, and basics.  This works for me because after a long cruise I can have my photos all ready to work on my new photobook.  I would give this a 5 star if there were more apps made for chrome,  it will not recognize an .exe program even if I have it on my flash drive.  It would be great to load a couple on a flash and have the system recognize them... but maybe that's not possible.  Otherwise this is going to work well for me.  I love having my mail come up just the way it is on my pc.  All my mail links work (and they don't on an android).  I bought a foam sleeve that I can slip this into, and carry it in my purse.

910,"I have been using Chromebooks for some time now, and I love them. I own a dell studio 15 and I was getting tired of lugging it around and having to fight for tables with outlets when studying at a coffee shop, or only getting an hour's work done before it died. I needed something smaller, lighter, and with a better battery life. While I would love a macbook air, I'm not in a position to spend $1200 for a device at this time. That's when I started looking at Chromebooks. The only hangup I had was that I had to be online to get any use out of it, and then I realized that I am always online. It takes a little bit to get it set up the way I wanted it but after that it does everything I need it to, I can even access my iCloud account online and update my to do list and calendar.  Well, almost. There are certain test that I have to take for school that I need a regular PC for, and then there is my iTunes account. For those I use my laptop at home. Even then I can remotely access my computer from anywhere. I love writing on it, the keyboard is very good. I used it on a trip to DC, and was able to get work done on the train gong up and back. The fact that I usually only charge it at night like a cell phone is a plus.  I will warn anyone who is considering buying one that this is not for those who need to replace their powerful PC, the lack of significant hardrive space and Chrome's limited OS will frustrate someone coming from a Macbook pro or other $1000 computer. This is for those who are already comfortable working in the cloud, or need a small, light, second computer with a great battery. If that's you then I highly recommend it.  As far as word processing goes, I have a skydrive account. I can access all of my documents, open them with the online version of Microsoft office. I'm a creature of habit and I don't like Google docs for daily use. I'm not really big photo social media guy, I only use Linked in and Facebook so I cannot speak to that for anyone. If I listen to music I use Google play and synced all of my iTunes music to it so I have access to everything I own. I rarely use the speakers, I prefer headphones as I am often out in public. I don't watch movies on the Chromebook, I only watch lectures for school and they are usually of poor video quality to begin with. If I'm gonna watch a movie I'll watch it on my HD tv at home, never really understood the need to watch movies on tiny screens. (I know I'm a boring old man).  So if you're looking for something that turns heads, and does everything your Mac (or your friends Mac) does don't buy a Chromebook. But if you need an inexpensive, reliable device for working in the cloud then this is for you.I love it

911,"Starts instantly as advertised, fairly good resolution, great for web browsing and email.  Some of the features on the Chromebook seem to have been designed with the primary motivation of annoying the user.  The lack of a simple caps on or off button and the inability to type caps by using shift key as with any normal computer are extremely annoying, especially when entering a robust password that uses some caps and some lower case.  Every time you need to type a capital letter you need to depress both the search key and the alt key to turn the cap function on and then repeat the steps to turn it off, all of which amounts to a time consuming task especially when considering that the feature doesn't always work.  What were the geniuses who put this feature in thinking?It is also difficult and time consuming to determine how to use certain features on the Chromebook such as changing the password on the machine.  Changing the password should be a simple procedure readily available in the settings section of the machine after logging in.  You would think that the lessons Steve Jobs taught the world about making consumer products intuitively easy to use would have sunk into someone's head at Samsung - unfortunately they didn't.Nice machine overall but there are much better choices out there.

My other concern was that it would be slow, but I have been able to have over a dozen tabs open, and continue to work at full speed.  The USB ports, and SD card slot, have worked well to transfer and share files as well.  Very happy with this purchase, just be sure to realize the limitations you will have.  If you need a small computer for travel, (You get 12 free Gogo Inflight Sessions to use as well!) this Chromebook fits the bill.

But the biggest point in all that is that at $250 each, it's much easier to afford a Chromebook for each child.Yes, there are a few things we have to work around, and the platform works best if you succumb to the whole Google cloud-based life.  But now when she goes to a friend's or to Starbucks to stidy or whatever,  she has a light, inexpensive platform that competently handles 95% of what she spent time doing on her Mom's Mac at 1/4 the initial cost.

932,"I do most of my power computing via remote desktop or while at work.  For home, i wanted something light with a long battery life.  The Chromebook is perfect for this ""lightweight"" need of mine!  It is preferable to me over an iPad or tablet, since it has a keyboard (I write a lot).  Have had no problems and am very happy with my purchase.

933,"Admittedly I house moderately inappropriate feelings of love for Google. But that said I was actually a little worried when I ordered a Chromebook because I wasn't terribly sure how things would work having only chrome web apps to rely on for all of my school work, homework, and just general internet life. Fortunately though I have to say that it readily soothed all of my concerns. For essentially every function that a regular laptop provides, there's a chrome app that covers it, to the point where almost everything that I deal with for all of my classes is accessible to me anywhere and on any computer, without having to worry about leaving files laying around on physical drives. Considering that almost every business offers free wifi, the fact that it needs the internet really doesn't affect the functionality at all, and nowadays the only thing that I don't use it for is torrenting, because no one's written an app for it yet. Oh, also it's super lightweight, doesn't heat up, and I carry it everywhere. Boom.

939,"Pros:Chrome OS is very easy to use as it's only a browser.It does more than a tablet for me despite being much cheaper.Durable built and not cheap.Light and doesn't heat.Battery lasts.Cons:The built in media player is very basic.The graphic card has a hard time with HD files or handling a second screen connected in HDMI.The processor can be overwhelmed rapidly if streaming and browsing at the same time.Most apps for Android are not compatible.I made the cons very specific, but I am generally very satisfied with this Chromebook especially considering its price Vs a tablet.

Core functionality built in right out of the box including office compatibility etc.4. Battery life is awesome.5. Design - Lightweight, great keyboard and touchpad.  While others have complained about the screen, I have no problems with it.Cons-1. Doesn't support Netflix2. Doesn't support Amazon Instant Video3. Out of the box native video support is limited.  You'll have to convert your videos to a supported format in order to play them from a flash drive.4. Application installations are limited to the chrome webstore (but I knew that ahead of time).Overall, I think this is a great purchase.  While there are some limitations, I believe this is a great price point for the hardware and included software.  This would be a perfect laptop for a student in college or high school considering that all office files are compatible using Google's Sheets, Slides, and Docs applications.  If your already in the Google world this is a no-brainer.11/14/12 Update - The latest Chrome OS update seems to have fixed the Amazon Instant Video issue.  I'm now able to stream from that service.  Netflix still doesn't work though.

My computing requirements are e-mail, word processor, spread sheet, books , music and web browsing. The chromebook does all this and much more.  16GB of user memory allows local storage of files used when there is no wi-fi. The rest of my stuff is in the cloud.

952,"I am a graduate student at a Cal State University who constantly needs to be on a computer. I am a student of linguistics, so I need to have PRAAT software on my computer. I also need to have a compiler like Code::Blocks for the electives in computer science I took. I need to have everything backed up multiple times: in the cloud, on the hard-drive, and on an external hard drive, as well.  Can my Samsung Chromebook do all that? Not really.However, the Chromebook is super lightweight, it stays charged for far longer than all my laptops and tablets, it even gives the option of linking this Chromebook to my desktop pc (that is Chrome’s remote access and it is available on the Chromebook already, but you will need to download remote access to your second device in order to connect)! It does have the basics for me: google docs (like word), google slides (like powerpoint), google sheets (like excel) and google photos. It also has shortcuts to youtube, which I have found to be convenient.I use it mainly for writing, reading emails, and combing through the library’s academic journal databases. If I was allowed to install software, I would have more programs running on this than there is right now. As is, I cannot install PRAAT, nor Code::Blocks, which is frustrating. Now, when I need to write code or record audio files, I bring my other Samsung laptop, the Samsung series 7 gamer, orange laptop. I hate doing this. I don’t like taking my gaming laptop outside of the house because it was expensive and it weighs a lot (and has a 17.3 inch screen). So, I have my everyday, minimalist Chromebook with me almost all the time and when I don’t it is because I needed a specific program to run and Chromebook cannot run outside software. This is the Chromebook’s achilles heel, and when I need something not so minimalist, I have to lug around my gaming laptop and leave the Chromebook at home.This works for me, mainly because I already own a collection of electronics and I have back-up computers lying around. If you are strapped for cash, however, and you need your Chromebook to allow programs like SPSS (statistics software) to be installed, I would recommend you look at another computer. I understand that outside software can have security problems, but that is the internet in general at the moment, and the fact that I cannot install software programs is the main reason for the 2 star deduction. I would love to give this Chromebook five stars! Sadly, the issue with the lack of available software programs deserves a 1 star deduction.The other star deduction is because google is attempting to recreate major applications in their own style (i.e. Google sheets versus Microsoft Word and Secure Shell app for Code::Blocks). This counts as a star deduction because I then had to spend a prolonged period of time researching which google app equivalent I needed, hunt it down, add it, and then learn how it works. For example, Code:Blocks is straightforward. Secure Shell (which I used in my introduction to programming class) is structured differently. At first, I spent about an hour reading through internet forums about how to write code in Chromebooks. I finally found Secure Shell, but by that time I was frustrated. I can only imagine what this would be like for someone who does not have backup computers.I guess what I am trying to say is that one must buy a Chromebook already prepared to learn new software applications, because you will. Also, it is a bit puzzling to find downloads. Everything opens up on the web and saves to the web. One has to fiddle with the control panel to save it offline.Here are the reasons for my three stars: superlight weight! Compact! Charge lasts a long time! No need for anti-virus! The Chromebook’s minimalist approach can be seen as a positive for some people! As soon as I lift the lid up, my Chromebook powers up in seconds! Inexpensive! Everything saves to the Cloud! I recommend the Chromebook for anyone who needs something only for essential cloud-based tasks. It also seems like it would make a cheap alternative for students at Universities, especially if their campus is like mine and spends quite a bit of money enticing students to walk in and buy a macbook...To sum up, the Chromebook is a minimalistic computer that works better than great for basic tasks but is below par when it comes to ease of use (because of all the googling I had to do to find the equivalent of Code:Blocks and Audacity) and functionality.One last note, I tried connecting a classroom projector to my Chromebook in order to show a powerpoint presentation, all to no avail. The Chromebook projected only the wallpaper on my screen (a picture of a fox), and completely ignored the google slides presentation that was clearly visible on the computer screen. I never did learn how to make that work.

Speakers are better than expected. It is easy to use and there is zero maintenance. If I need to run a big spreadsheet, my HP desktop blows it away - as it should. I can't put the big HP on my knees while I'm watching football games (unless I want to have broken knees). The Chromebook is not for everyone.

It arrived and was easy to set up EXCEPT the first time I tried to sign on to our router, and it asked for the password, I didn't realize it wanted the router NETWORK administrator password.  I sent an email from my desktop to the CB people.  They returned my call in a couple of hours and a VERY nice person helped me determine what the heck was going on.Anyway.  My husband uses the CB every day.  He's happy with it, except the screen is a bit smaller than the laptop.  I changed the font size for him, and he's okay with it now. Also, the bookmarks don't work quite the same way he was used to.  I organized his favorite links into a fewer number of 'folders'.  The folder names are displayed across the top of his screen, so he is just a couple of clicks away from getting wherever he needs to go.I found it odd that to lock in the capital letters, one must press the Alt key and the Shift key.  There's no 'Caps Lock' key.I plan on getting a CB for myself after I migrate my desktop stuff to the cloud.  Then I'll join the happy crowd who can tell Microsoft Windows to 'stuff it' !

It works, and is designed to be a front-end to Google's services (including the excellent Google Apps, which I have found is good enough to take the place of Microsoft Office, for my purposes) and can view and work with most any website.2.  Small and light.  It's like carrying around a thin hardback book.3.  Screen is big enough for average uses.  I even play a ""Massive Multiplayer Online"" game with it, through my 4G cellphone hotspot, and it does fairly good with it.  Amazing.4.  Keyboard is good.  No complaints.  And that's a reason I would never go with a tablet -- I want a full keyboard for touch-typing (and don't want to fiddle with some add-on gizmo).Weaknesses:A.  Battery life is pretty short.  Consider your battery powered time to be limited to a few hours.B.  Touch-pad doesn't work well if you're holding it in your lap.  Works best when it's sitting on a table.  Particularly tricky to do things like click-and-drag, or right-click.  But again, it works fine if it's sitting on a table (and you master the gestures to do it).C.  They don't include a 12v charger, and the only third-party models I've found cost a small fortune.  Ridiculous.

Consider the following down sides, from my perspective.Generationally speaking, I have a full grasp of PCs & laptops and their potential for storing items in the machine........the idea of 'the cloud' is not new to me, but one I'm not able, or willing to fully accept.............consider that upon purchaseI was also unable to mentally grasp the 'Big Brother' angle in terms of Google being Omni-present - I suppose the idea of them taking over the world is acceptable, but for now, let's keep some 'local ' controlFairly limited in terms of ports - a single 2.0 USB and a single 3.0 USB (which was a bit stubborn in accepting any hardware) and an HDMI..............which if you've seen in multiple forums, simply has issues in terms of connectivity with TVs and external monitors - I lost track of all the nonsense with this issue. One of the primary reason in trying this unit was to view Netflix on my TV - I was never able to connect and in turn spent hours searching for solutions, to no avail. Consider this factor carefully.....Yes, it updates and virus can be kept at bay; it starts up lightning quick and has the potential to a nice middle ground between an Apple and or Windows based machine, but for all intents and purposes, it's a tablet w/ a keypad......not entirely practical.Considering it's price & features, if you have a tablet, dig in and see what it can do - they are pretty powerful, some as with mine, run Polaris - a Windows Office suite - which cannot be housed on the Chromebooks. A couple hundred bucks more gets a user into real storage space that's local, can run Office and do those things you 'grew up' doing.Maybe someday the Chrome OS will be more legit - they certainly have an idea of what they want to do, but I'm not sure they are all in at this stage of the game.

986,"I use this for college mainly because it is SUPER light and it starts up quick. If I were to gripe about it however, then it would be a gripe on the google servers. The Chromebook relies entirely on the google servers for Google docs (the google version of microsoft word). If the server is down, or even slow, then it can get really frustrating when you need to find/write notes quickly in class. I would say that i have problems with google docs about 40% of the time.

The keyboard did take some getting use to and once I learned I could customize some of the keys it made it easier. Also the Chrome part takes some getting use to. Its not like a regular laptop, its more like a giant android with a lot of the same restrictions. But for a second laptop it is perfect. I love mine.

990,"I had it for 2 months before it started with any problems. It got to where it didn't want to wake up or start up. Once I got it to wake up, I'd forget and shut the lid down and then it would not wake up again. I got ahold of the people I had warranty with and they  told me that I still had warranty with Samsung, So, I got emailed them and they never responded. So, I got ahold of Amazon and they refunded my money. Then I got ahold of the people that I had the 2 yr warranty and got a full refund. I will not buy another chromebook. Just not happy with that situation.Maybe I got a bad batch of them, but I wasn't willing to try a replacement. I didn't care for the size of it. Being it was my first laptop, I was really disappointed. And the next one I buy, I will really shop and go in stores to see if I like it. I wasn't sure how I would like the fact that you couldn't download anything to it. Didn't like the fact that it didn't have a disc drive or whatever you call it.I did like the keyboard, so easy to type with. it was a nice small laptop at first. Lightweight.

991,"I know this computer is only $250 but I can't believe how defective this unit is straight out of the box.Upon turning it on and going through the activation process I went to adjust the angle of the screen and it promptly turned to a red hue. I moved the screen to a new angle and it went back to normal. Attempted to continue to welcome process and it again turned red along with lines across the top.I restarted the Chromebook hoping to alleviate the problem. It did not. I have done a factory reset and that doesn't stop it either. Sometimes if I play with the angle of the monitor the color will go back to normal.So, I've asked Amazon for a replacement and of course they're quick and on top of things like usual. I love Amazon.In the meantime, I've tried to use the Chromebook despite the red screen. It has also crashed while on Amazon (reading negative reviews on the Chromebook...lol) and the ""h"" key sticks to where it naturally gets stuck down and I have to lightly tap it to put it back in place or it puts ""h's"" across the screen.In addition, after it crashed it got really, really hot and it was sitting on a counter top. Also, I fully charged it this afternoon when I receive it and just a few hours later without being used the battery is at 37%. Based on reviews I know this isn't standard.I'm going to cross my fingers that the next one is good but so far I'm completely unimpressed and it also makes me worry that even if the next one functions fine out of the box that it will stop working within a few months. I'm not real keen on spending 25% of the purchase price on a warranty either.

992,"I bought this for my 8 year old to replace her Mac Book, and truth be told, to see how it performs for business.  So far it has some very nice pluses for the design - ultra thin, quiet as a church mouse, cool at all times, good size for typing and navigating, clickable touchpad is also a nice feature, along with the right click and scrolling functions.On the minus side - the screen feels a little less than sturdy when opening, the operating system takes some getting used to - not much, especially if you're an android user, the screen can be difficult to read, the general tactile feel could be improved with the use of higher quality polycarbonates or aluminiumI expected that any apps I had on other mobile devices would automatically be available on the Chromebook, but that has not been the case.I continue to explore, and will have to update as more time elapses.04/07/13*Update*Still not quite sure why some apps are not available here which are on Nexus 7 and mobile devices, but device is still going well.

993,"The Samsung Chromebook is apparently susceptible to the screen going bad, where Samsung will predetermine when you call them, that you the customer damaged it.  Based on searches on the Internet, cracked or damaged or bad screens on this product is common,.  Within 5 seconds of talking to someone at Samsung about returning the Chromebook for warranty repair, the person on the phone said to me 'you stepped on it', and this was just so out of the blue.  When I returned the product for repair, I got an email note saying the warranty was void due to ""cracked lcd screen"".  I did not damage this unit.I highly recommend the Samsung Chromebook NOT be purchased due to apparently widespread screen problems where Samsung denies responsibility for it.

998,"This is my second Samsung Chromebook.  My first was a first generation one (stolen).Both have been great in similar ways -- price is right; often fast connection; keyboard comfortable.  And this one is considerably lighter than my old one.  The Chromebook should be fabulous for online and cloud use (forgive my non technical terms; they're all I've got), and it usually is.  BUT I have found serious connection bugs with wifi.  I'm ok at home, but at cafes, etc., I'm sometimes unable to connect when no one else is having a problem.  If they restart their router, I'm usually ok for a period.  That period could be months, or mere days.  And at one place, no amount of router restarting helps; I pretty much don't go to that cafe anymore because of this.  And, of course, it's awkward/annoying to have to ask a worker to restart their router. I've done all the trouble shooting I could with my limited skills; a few times it's helped to take the troubling network off the ""preferred"" list, but more often it doesn't help.I was hoping that my new one would be less temperamental, but it is not.  Disappointing because otherwise it's a great product.  I only know one other person with a Chromebook, my mom, and she does not take it out of the house and has no problems.  So I don't have other experiences to compare to and did not find much mention of my problem online.  The hint on the ""preferred network"" came from a friend.  So....not sure what to say in conclusion.  Gave it four stars instead of three because...well, I suppose I want to err on the side of this not being a widespread problem since I have found hardly anything about it online.

1000,"I recommend Samsung's Chromebook because I've enjoyed it so much during the past 6 months.  The battery lasts as advertised, and the instant-on makes my Chromebook the first computer I turn to unless I need to use a special program, such as Publisher. I never worry about updates or bugs. I don't have to mess with antivirus software and spend all that time waiting for scans to complete. This thing is simple, simple, simple. It's always playtime. Primarily, I use my Chromebook for entertainment.  I like to look up actors while watching tv to see what else they have done or to check on their biography during commercials. I like to watch Netflix with a headset while other people watch the television; and of course e-mail and social media.  I compose on Chromebook and save my stuff to the cloud.  So I made a commitment to put in the time and effort to adapt to this little machine and to Google's approach to computing. It has a few frustrating points. The cursor tends to jump around when I'm typing, which can be very annoying. Maybe turning off the touch pad when composing would solve that. The keyboard is very sensitive. The keyboard is also pretty cool once you learn the special keys and combinations. I really like Google Drive and working within the web browser. I'm naive enough to think Google isn't going to let that Cloud lose my stuff. I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.

1002,"aaaaah-mazing. My family and I love our Samsung Chromebook. LOVE. LOVE. LOVE. If you are not computer savvy, and use Google services, this is the computer for you. We've had this over a year, nothing has every gone wrong with it, it updates itself without harassing me, the battery life is amazing, and I don't have to worry about my kids wrecking a computer. It is really quite sturdy, easy to hold in your lap or work with at a desk. The mouse is super easy to use - in fact everything about this is super easy to use. There is zero waiting for your computer to start. You open it and are ready to go. Everything about the computer is fast, fast, fast.My kids love how they can customize their own account. At the home screen, they log-in to their Google account, and up pops the wallpaper they've chosen, they apps they've downloaded, their screen just they way they've arranged it. And the same goes for me. I don't have to worry about them messing up my stuff, because they don't log into my account.My problems with it:- no iTunes (maybe someone with more computer savvy could make this work?)- Amazon Instant video crashes frequently enough that it's a problem.- Netflix doesn't play on it. It says it does, but it really doesn't. At least not easily enough for me to figure out.- your options are Google Play and Google play for streaming video- you have to have wi-fi for the computer to function in any meaningful way.Overall, LOVE IT. The pros far outweigh the cons. My dad bought one of these on my recommendation, and he loves it too. Even though the screen is much smaller than his previous computer, the ease of use well makes up for it.

1030,"I was scared off from some of the reviews about this Chrome Book but I find it to be excellant.  No boot up time, no worrying about the operating system, it just works really well.  It is built well with a piano hinge across the entire spline, keyboard is chicklet style and has a nice feel to it when typing,  The touchpad works great and allows you to set it to 'Australian' style so you can zip through FB newsfeeds in no time with simple two fingered hand gestures.  The screen resolution is much better than I thought it was going to be from what I read in the reviews, it is on the shady side of bright but it really does not diminish how good everything looks.  The USB ports are on the back and that seemed weird at first but how often do you have to get to them?  I haven't used my camera with it yet but i'm sure it will work fine .  I play FB games, email etc and have 6-7 tabs open at a time and and no great noticeable slowdown at all.  My battery is only lasting 5 hours not 6 but I don't know if that is typical for Chrome Books or if it is just me.  When you pick it up to carry with screen up it does not bend in your hand and the screen stays where you put it so I feel it is built well.  The Chrome Web Store has a ton of different apps for you to choose from for stuff online and offline,  a lot of them are just dumb and no more than a fancy book mark that brings you to an online site.  I think this is great if you don't want to learn about operating systems and updating constantly and you want a nice easy way to surf the web, read a book or listen to some music.  The speakers in this are surprisingly loud for such a small space.  I would buy another one in a heartbeat .

1031,"Chrome OS is great operating system for students and individuals who use no desktop software.  If you live on the internet, particularly with Google services, there isn't a need for a bulky desktop with terrible battery life and features you'll never use anyway.  Chrome OS is Chrome Internet Browser, that's about it.  It sounds funky at first, but it's the most SECURE and bloatless PC you can purchase.  I won't comment anymore on the OS, so let's get to the hardware.  The PC is a great buy for the price, it is plastic with a brushed aluminum look.  It's not flimsy but it does feel a bit cheap (well it's because it is after all) but not a terrible thing.  The keyboard takes some personal adjustment since it is not a full size, but you'll adapt quickly.  The screen has pretty horrible viewing angles, but I think it is justified by the price.  I'd give this five stars if the screen had a wider viewing angle.  I'd have to say try it and a tablet and see if you would prefer one, the other, or both.

1037,"First, I am a huge fan of the Chromebooks and had one of the last generation from my work.  I bought the $250 Chromebook about two months ago as a personal laptop and have been very happy with it.First thing to know, THIS IS NOT A REGULAR LAPTOP.  You don't download and run programs like you do with Windows or Macs.  Imagine everything you do in your web browser like mail, Google Docs, Facebook, Netflix, Hulu, web browser games, etc. Please make sure you understand what this laptop is and does.  I use it for school and only the thing that didn't work for me was MiniTab, a statistical program which only runs on windows.If you had an older version of a Chromebook, this is much lighter and thinner!  I consider it a perfect travel laptop and have taken it on a couple of trips already.  There is a trade-off between battery life and CPU speed, because the Samsung 5 was slower (to the point of being a negative) but the battery life was 9+ hours - really.  I downloaded movie AVIs and literally watched movies for a 6 hour flight.  So, overall I am happy with the trade-off and like the beefier CPU with 6 hours of battery.  The extra USB port is good as I like to have a wireless mouse and sometimes put in a USB key.Security wise, you can not ask for a better laptop.  All code is signed and downloaded from Google.  You can not add software unless you put it in developer mode, which you can clearly see warnings to avoid confusion.  No malware can exist and Google has hacking bake-offs to find and pay information security researchers.Overall, the 'Poor Mans MacBook Air' is a total winner at $250.  Really: no virus, patching, reloading stuff, and the typical computer things you have to do.  Patches apply automatically and since everything is stored in the cloud, you can wipe it and be working in minutes.Last thing, if you need PC remote control - there is a Chrome Remote from Google.

1041,"This product is superb for a user that does not need desktop applications.  Folks invested into the Google ecosystem will find it quite natural.  The operating system (Chrome) is very light weight and out of the user's way.  The keyboard is comfortable and functional.  Battery life has satisfied (~6.5hrs actual use).  Multiple account support is very clean and easy.The screen is a matte finish and you will definitely notice it's quality isn't the highest (although to be fair I am comparing this to my desktop's ultra sharp).Recommended overall.

1044,"I'll post more about the device itself as we learn to use it - unless we decide to return it, which we may. So this review is at this point about buying one used from Amazon.The device itself is pretty cute and we like it, but buying it used from Amazon isn't the deal it seemed to be.The entire theory of chromebooks, which don't have much internal storage, is that everything happens in the cloud. To that end, chromebooks come with some freebies. But if you buy one used from Amazon, you DON'T GET these freebies.The biggie is Google Drive. New chromebooks get 100gb of google drive service for two years. We just tried to activate this on the ""like new"" one sent to us by Amazon Warehouse, and no - it's not eligible. That's a $120 freebie, at what google charges, that we don't get if we keep this computer.  There are similar deals for streaming music, etc... but the loss of the google drive offer may be the dealbreaker for us.Without it, the device only has its 16gb flash storage. We could stick an SD card into it, but that's really not how it was designed to work.Just posting this review to make potential buyers aware of this large downside to buying used.

1048,"My grandparents have been flirting with the idea of buying a computer for some time now.  When I realized they were about to spend $1200 on a ""senior"" computer that had nothing but a touchscreen and a higher magnified screen I thought we should give the Chromebook a try first at $250.  The fact that the OS is so streamlined and everything is cloud based actually make it simpler for first time users in my opinion.  I was also surprised that the case itself felt extremely similar to a MacBook, which is highly regarded from a quality aspect with the solid body aluminum construction.There has been a little learning curve, but nothing comparable to a windows type environment.  Cheap price, way less cluttered OS, mainly all web based apps, and everything stored on the cloud makes this a winner in my book for seniors!

1054,"See Update below.My 5 yr old Macbook was slowing down. With a Chromebook I replaced most of what I used it for with a slick little device.My Chromebook came with 2 years of 100 MG/mo Verizon 3g service included. I tried to set up the 3G and got an error message - ""try again later"". 3 trys, no luck, but I had noticed that there was no SIM card in the SIM card slot. The error message said to call Verizon if problems persisted, but given there was no SIM card, I incorrectly concluded that was the problem. Two hours later - over an hour chatting with completely unknowledgeabe people at Samsung who were telling me I have to get a SIM card from Verizon and almost an hour on the phone with Verizon it all works. The Verizon capability does not require a SIM card in the slot. If you have a problem, just call Verizon like the error message tells you to.The build is cheesy but seems solid enough when closed. The frame around the screen feels like it could be snapped off with your finger nail.I love how cool it runs - no fan.100 MG a month is very little - loading 30 or 40 web pages? But for $3.30 a month it seemed like it might come in handy for occasional travel or when the local WIFI is down or emergencies.  I like the data plan pay-as-you-go upgrade options.UPDATE - I misunderstood the data plan options and have reduced my rating from 5 stars to 3. The Verizon I learned to despise decades ago is back. They ""offer"" a one day unlimited data plan for $9.99. Turns out one now has to use up all your 100 mg before you can buy data. So if you want to video chat from a family reunion at the cabin with relatives who couldn't make it you can only do so by giving up all data access for the rest of the month unless you spring for a GB. Screw you Verizon.They also have removed the ability to check data usage against the 100 free MG. You only know when it's gone and they offer to sell you more. Screw you Verizon.To check data usage call their number for prepaid plans - 888-294-6804 - with your ""phone number"" which they give you when you establish service and the pin number that you set at that time.

I am very techy so I like a quad core fancy laptop for my primary machine but this one meets my travel needs and all my guests have been happy to have their very own laptop when they visit. When my guest leaves, I like the fact that I can delete his/her user from the chromebook and ""poof"", the chromebook is again in the state it was before I loaned it.

1058,"After my Android tablet liberated me from the rigid confines of my my desk by allowing me to surf the web and check email while on the couch or in bed, far from my desktop computer, I longed for even more freedom. I spend most of my computer time doing various word processing activities, and for that my very nice tablet is no reasonable substitute for a desktop computer. This Chromebook however, is perfect. It's inexpensive, lightweight, simple, and ready to use right out of the box.Because it's lightweight and doesn't get hot, it's very comfortable to sit with a Chromebook actually on your lap--something I haven't found to be true with other laptops. The plastic cover looks almost as good as the heavier casings on more expensive laptops, but it is easy to scratch so be careful. I'll review two aspects of the Chromebook--its functionality for word processing and its use as a back-and-forth to school computer for students.For word processing:  I hadn't used Google Docs much before I got the Chromebook, but it's a fine substitute for Word--the only thing I really  miss from Word is the ability to get synonyms with just a right click. I still use Word on my desktop computer, but since Google Docs can turn Word documents into Google Doc documents and visa versa it's possible to go back and forth between Word on my regular computer and Google Docs on my Chromebook very easily. I assumed I would end up wanting to get a bluetooth mouse, especially for the many times that I have to cut and paste while writing, but the trackpad is completely simple to use for this and for everything a mouse does so I haven't bothered. The keyboard keys are nicely spaced, not crowded. One thing I especially love about word processing on the Chromebook is that since it boots up and is ready to go so quickly I can grab a few minutes here and there to write--times that would be impractical on my desktop with its longer come to life time. Also with the Chromebook it's possible to write anywhere, including places without an internet connection since Google Docs can be used off-line.For students:  The students I see in my tutoring business have been very taken with the Chromebook, and after trying mine at least one of my students will be getting her own for Christmas. Her parents had been planning on getting her an iPad, but the Chromebook is both less expensive and more functional. Without buying any extra software students can research, write and print reports, essays or homework on it, and many of my students have already started using Google Docs instead of Word  because it allows for collaboration when they are doing group projects.  Most young people  are comfortable storing things in the cloud or moving things off and on flash drives so the small amount of storage isn't an issue for them , and the Chromebook's light weight is a real plus considering how heavy their backpacks can be. The Chrome Store has a lot of apps, always an enticement, and most of them free. Then there is the cool factor--the Chromebook looks good, and who doesn't appreciate that in an electronic device?I'm not ready to give up my desktop computer, with its large amount of storage and ability to add software, but as a second computer I could not be happier with my Chromebook. Being able to use the Chromebook to write while sitting on my couch in front of the fireplace is heaven.

Anyone that is looking for full functionality of a Window or Apple may not like this.  I do not do any other stuff on this Chromebook.Offline Gmail is also perfect for me when traveling.Since Wi-Fi is becoming more and more prevalent everywhere you go nowadays, getting connected (which is main reason this machine exists) is really not a big problem unless one demands connection 24/7.Those who complain about machine being just a browser is missing the point.

1073,"I've had a little while to play around with my Chromebook and I love it so far. The battery life is the first thing that blows me away. I am used to my junky old Windows laptop which will get maybe 2 hours tops. One evening I unplugged the Chromebook, used it for about an hour, and then just left it on the counter until the next evening. I didn't expect the thing to have a charge, much less even turn on. I opened it up and it still had 54%, enough for a few more hours of use. The battery life is great. It's also fairly light and portable. It's not a Window's PC but if you normally use Chrome then you will be right at home. In all reality, what else do you use a computer for other than the web? Sure, you can have one at home if you really need it but the Chromebook can do just about anything. If you really need your PC functionality on your Chromebook, just use Chrome remote desktop. It's just like Splashtop, TeamViewer, or any of the other remote desktops, except for the fact that it's free and super easy to use. Anytime I must use MS Office, or the like, boom, remote desktop. It really is great. The only small gripes I have are the fact that since it's a small screen, the text and everything is also quite small. Not a big deal but it's quite a difference from my 15"" PC screen. Also, the photo viewing/editing app is quite featureless. Apart from those two small things, I can't think of any issues. For a total of $266, this laptop is a great bang for your buck. I will be recommending a Chromebook to my friends and family from now on.

Originally I was going to purchase a tablet (Nexus 7 or Kindle Fire HD) but I really wanted something I could do work on. The Chromebook had everything I wanted including a keyboard, word processor, and it was easily portable. Here is what I think:Pros:- The quality of the laptop was incredible. I was at first wary of the all plastic build, but its very solid and smooth. I wasn't wild about the hinge on the outside, but I understand that is to make it more thin. The whole laptop feels great!- The mobility is awesome...this thing is as light and thin as a Macbook Air. It can easily slip into a backpack or purse without being a nuisance.- Zero moving parts, this actually really makes a difference. There are no vents blowing out hot air, it makes no noise, and it doesn't heat up at all!-------------------Cons:- Not really a knock on the product itself, but it took me a long time to get my hands on one. Google hasn't done the greatest job meeting the demand for this item. Every store I went to was sold out of these laptops and didn't know when they would get any more.-------------------So, overall this is a great product! I suppose that, price included, this is one the greatest netbooks to ever hit the shelves. Just please know what this product is before you buy it, because it isn't a workhorse laptop to run programs. What it can do though is all your internet tasks plus word processing with ease.

The CB boots up in 2-5 seconds not even the 10 seconds they state in product description. I had been concerned about being able to print but Google solved that with their slick ""Cloud Printing"" app. Set it up once and it's good to go from there. As for my concern on how to get scanned documents into Google Drive (where I had been storing my documents for years), it turns out that my printer has WiFi capabilities so now that becomes a non issue.By the way, I have connected my 24"" monitor and keyboard to the CB and you'd never know that you're on a very light, extremely good looking and thin laptop. It really gets some heads turning at Starbucks. Use the WiFi or in my case 3G.I love this and am already about to get one for each person in my family.

1083,"Well, new and in original packaging as and on time as promised so good work to the seller. The chromebook itself is a neat piece of technology for students. I can only make reference to myself because I am a student. So you know when you're typing that long paper for class and you're almost done but you forget to save along the way and the system blanks off...I hate that -_- however with the chromebook, all documents are saved automatically as you go along letter by letter and it's saved online so if the thing crashes or breaks, u can access your work using another device. It's very fast in terms of setup and overall speed. Entertainment, you can watch movies off netflix or online streaming...forget torrents cuz it doesn't work. It was a little disappointing for me but on the other hand it was meant for school lol. You can listen to ur music but my advice is to get a better mp3 player on the chrome store as you can't use the original one for customizing with playlists and so on. You get free space on google drive however it doesn't automatically end up on your account, you have to activate it whenever you're ready. It's ultra light and sleek so it's good for dragging to school and also cheap so if anything was to happen to it...at least it wasn't a mac book. Over all it's really nice, no fan, runs quietly, no overheating. It doesn't have a caps lock button :/ but that doesn't really bother me. It might just have a shortcut to use it but haven't looked for that yet. Surfing the net is great and again...it's so darn light. Only thing I don't like is the fact that as long as someone has a google account, they can add user and sign in so be careful as it can be stolen easily and secondly, it restarts automatically for updates. So u'll be doing work or watching a video and the screen would blank out to update which is like literally 2 seconds. Good thing is that the work is saved already so you don't lose it and everything that was open at the time automatically reopens. The updates don't happen that often. It just gets annoying when u're watching a movie cuz it starts over and u have to skip through lol.

1090,"First of all, I really appreciate all the reviewers who shared their experience.  Both positive and negative reviews provided great insights into an exciting new product with some unknowns.  I received the 3G version of Samsung Chromebook 11.6"" from Amazon a few days ago, and my experience so far has been very positive.  I'll focus on less-discussed topics, i.e. Language inputs, Verizon 3G, Bluetooth, USB ports, and useful Apps for Chromebook.Language - I write documents in English and Japanese, so the ability to input and switch between the two is very important to me.  I'm very pleased with Chrome OS in this regard for two reasons.  First, it's easy to add and configure multiple languages and input methods.  Go to Settings, add a language, and select input methods.  There appear to be more than 50 language options available.  Second, it's a one-click operation (press Shift-Alt) to switch between languages.  The Japanese fonts are limited at the moment, but for now, I'm very happy with this.Verizon 3G - Since this is a cloud device and my mobile workstation, the ability to connect both WLAN and WWAN is important to me.  I paid the extra $80 upfront (price difference between 3G and non-3G versions at Amazon) for the WWAN capability and 100MB/mo for 2 years included.  Activating the Verizon 3G was easy and took about 3 minutes.  I was connected immediately at a reasonable 2.4 Mbps download, 0.8 Mbps upload speed, measured by Speakeasy, San Francisco hub.  3G is not supposed to be used when I'm connected to both WiFi and 3G, so in theory I should be able to conserve my 100MB quota while I'm on Wifi.  However, as expected, 3G was used even when Wifi was available.  Wifi connection sometimes fails or takes a moment to connect/reconnect, especially waking from sleep mode.  When that happens, 3G mode kicks in immediately, eating into the allotted quota.  To avoid this, disable 3G while using Wifi, and enable 3G only when needed.  Enabling/disabling 3G or Wifi is a simple three-click operation.USB ports - I plugged in a USB mouse (MS 4000), and it worked without any noticeable delay.  That was actually a pleasant surprise because I'm used to the Windows behavior that normally takes a few moments of checking and installing drivers.  I did not see such delay in Chromebook, that's nice.  I also connected my USB drive (WD 300GB) and it worked fine.  A folder window popped up with all the content displayed.  Both USB and USB 3.0 ports worked just the same.Bluetooth - I tried my Bluetooth mouse (MS 5000).  Unlike USB mouse, I had to go into Settings and configure Bluetooth in order to make it work.  Chrome Settings is a one-stop shop for all configurations, so once you get used to it, it doesn't feel like a chore to make changes, unlike Windows . . .Once enabled and paired a device, the mouse worked fine.  However, whenever I turn off my BT mouse or put Chromebook in sleep mode, I have to wait for the mouse to reconnect, which takes about 5 seconds.  The USB mouse does not have such delay.  My understanding is that this Chromebook does not work with Bluetooth audio devices yet.Useful Apps for Chromebook - Over the past few years, I gradually transitioned from using MS Word/Excel/Powerpoint to OpenOffice Writer/Calc/Impress, and now to Google Docs/Sheets/Slides.  There are increasingly many useful apps, in particular I like LucidChart for diagramming, Pixlr Editor for image editing, and shiftEdit for coding in Perl, PHP, and Javascript.Chrome Remote Desktop is a very useful tool for Chromebook, works like VNC or pcAnywhere.  The response is fast, display is clear, it almost feels like I'm actually sitting in front of my main PC.  It was very nice to be able to access Quickbooks, Outlook, and local files that I did not upload, while sitting in a cafe.Speech Recognizer is a voice dictation app.  It makes use of Google Chrome Speech API, wrapped in a simple Google Search-like interface.  The Chromebook's built-in microphone works very well for me.  I tried both English (USA) and Japanese to dictate, and the recognition accuracy was excellent.As many of you discovered, the Chromebook is not for everyone.  But soon it will find its users and become indispensable for people like me.

1091,"The chromebooks are great for anyone who doesn't need a whole lot of computing power. You can create and edit documents, browse the web, listen to music, and most other needs. This computer is very fast thanks to the light operating system and the solid state drive but there is not a lot of space for local storage. The cloud storage and external usb drives help. I would recommend this to anyone who has a lot of problems with traditional operating systems and doesn't need to run windows/mac specific programs.

Chrome OS is missing or damaged.  Went through MULTIPLE attempts of recoverying the OS. I used a MAC and a Windows PC to work with the chromebook recovery utility. Google says if it doesn't work use a DIFFERENT flash drive or SSD card.  I bought a 16 GB flash drive and 16 GB SSD card, which is another $ 40.00 expense.  The chromebook would not recognize either.  Unreliable. Amazon is going to refund my purchase price 100% and is paying for the return shipping label.  THANK YOU AMAZON!!

There is also the Google equivalent of Microsoft's office products, and you can convert any documents to a word/excel/PowerPoint document if you need to switch back and forth to the respective formats.The only downside is that there is not a lot of local storage on the device.

1104,"Chromebook arrived about a week ago. I bought it as a backup computer for emailing and video playback. We watch TV and movies mainly via streaming, so I thought that it would be nice to have my laptop back while my daughter is watching cartoons on Netflix. As it turns out, Netflix is not supported in Chrome OS. I came across a number of other video streaming sites that do not work on Chromebook. For example, my parents are visiting from Europe ans so I signed them up for a streaming TV service in their native language. The site is not working on Chromebook, although it works fine on my other laptop. My idea of designating Chromebook as the main video streaming machine obviously did not work out, so I sent it back yesterday. Overall, I liked the computer very much and sent it back with a substantial hint of sadness. I think Goggle needs some time to integrate this new computer better with what customers like and expect to do online. When that happens, I may buy it again.

1107,"I'm in college and wanted a cheap, lightweight laptop to use in class and at the library. This is that laptop. Lots of reviewers say it doesn't do this and that, well that's because it's a Chromebook and it's not meant to. It does everything it's supposed to, nothing more, nothing less. Great for internet and writing papers, that's about all. It also has an insane battery life, with a full charge lasting 6 hours. What helped me make my decision was a YouTube video of the Chromebook. There are a couple out there that will tell you the pros and cons of the Chromebook.For me the cons are it can't run Java and no backlit keyboard. Lately I've had a problem with connecting to the internet at my school. When I boot up the laptop it'll prompt you to log in to your Google account, just enter your password and go. Well what has been happening instead of saying ""Enter password"" ""Sign in"" will show up like it's the first time with the laptop. So I click ""Sign in"" and it has to connect to the internet to do so. For some reason it will not connect to either my university's secure wifi or guest, nor my wifi hotspot off my phone. When I got home it would connect fine. It hasn't done this for a while but when it did the laptop is unusable. Other than that it's pretty good.

1113,"I have owned this Chromebook for two years now but stopped using it for two reasons. First, we got Acer C720 Chromebook (11.6-Inch, 2GB) from a Kindle Offer sale a year ago. Second, and more importantly, the last time we used this chromebook, we got the horrifying and mystifying BLACK SCREEN OF DEATH where everything freezes, goes dark and won't respond. After several minutes of frantic hitting CTRL+ALT+DEL and attempts to shut it off, it appeared that the chromebook was dead in the water. Nothing worked. I was annoyed because we were not at all rough or careless with it, not even my kids. A week after it appeared to die, we turned it on again and were astounded to find it working again. However, once we got the Acer Chromebook, we never went back to the Samsung Chromebook because no one wanted to chance getting the black screen of death again and losing all work.  Recently, we learned about the paperclip trick to boost the chromebook and it worked.  Still nervous, though, about continuing to use this one.

1119,"One caveat: I am a big google user, i have used the Chrome browser since its rollout in 2008 and i was one of the lucky few to get to test the ChromeOS/chromebook idea with a CR-48. That being said, i use google's services everyday and are comfortable with them. If you dont use gmail, and have never heard of google docs and the cloud is something that rain comes out of, then the chromebook may not be for you.After repeatedly checking package tracking on Amazon, the status on my Chromebook order finally changed to ""Shipped"" and I called my town's post office to confirm it was indeed there. The guy running the place was amazed i knew it was there, since he had not done any final scans on his boxes. Needless to say, i rushed home and got ready to open my new Chromebook.Due to noisy and nosy kids i won't be able to do the google hangout like i wanted to, so a good written review will have to do.The Samsung 303C12 Chromebook (MSRP $249.99)Unboxing: Nothing spectacular. Multi-language quick start guide, some safety precaution stuff, basically nothing to read. ONE THING THAT DID KIND OF UPSET ME..NO CHROME STICKER! I have watched a few unboxings on youtube and everyone got a cool chrome logo sticker. Slightly bummed out.Comes with a pretty small (in comparison to other laptops) AC power supply with a fairly long cord.Looks and feel: Picking it up for the first time, i knew right away that the claims of it being lightweight and portable were true. I'd say it weighs about half as much as my CR-48. I could see myself carrying this around a lot, it is uber light. Very slim and smooth lines. The majority of the ports are along the back edge, with the exception of the headphone jack and the SD card slot, which are up on the upper left hand side. I didn't feel any flimsiness about it at all. The only ""blemish"" i have about the case is the rounded hinge on the lid. The look Samsung was going for here was the Macbook Air, it is pretty obvious that this is a clone of that when it comes to styling. The keyboard is a dream to type on, even better than the CR-48. The key buttons remind me a lot of a macbook. It has the chrome keys along the top replacing the traditional F1-F10 keys and the CAPS LOCK key is replaced by a search key.Actual use: First boot up was quick and fast, just have to select some geographic things and then point it to your wireless connection. Then you log in with your Google ID and it goes to the desktop. Earlier versions of ChromeOS didnt have the desktop, but now youre presented with a nice background picture and icons on the bottom right and a clock on the bottom right along with wifi gauge and battery life indicator. Very windows like in that regard.But one thing for sure, you would have to be a big believer in google services such as gmail, docs, calendar, maps, picasa and others to get full use out of a chromebook. I am making the transition to nothing but chromebooks in my house and so far everyone is getting things done with few complaints.Performance wise it works quite well, there is no fan, it doesnt get hot and renders webpages well. I havent had any issues with youtube, netflix, hulu, or any other streaming media site. Flash and PDF viewer is built in, so there is no need to go hunt down plugins from adobe.Your portal for additional apps is the chrome web store, with just about everything you need there. Word is out that this is going to get a makeover soon and look more along the lines of the Google play store for android devices.The chromebook does have a webcam, while not a HD cam it will do the job for just talking to others. Skype is not supported so face to face networking is handled by using Google+ Hangouts. Adding people is as simple as getting their gmail from them. And hangouts has the ability to video chat with up to 9 people at once.Battery life is stated at 6 and a half hours and depending on use, it will get that easily. Probably a little less if youre doing nothing on it but watching Netflix.The screen is a matte finish to reduce glare and looks very nice. I have no issues with at all with it.The touchpad...well what can i say about this...im a longtime desktop computer user and i dislike touchpads of any sort. The first thing i did was plug in my wireless mouse so i didnt have to use it. But it is usable, and from all reports works very well, and the tracking speed can be adjusted in settings.All in all, this is a great device. I plan to use it daily and finally ditch windows and not have to worry about that anymore.

A few minuses...1) The screen tilts back only 130 degrees, which isn't quite enough when holding the computer on my lap or standing at a counter looking down. As others have noted the screen is dim when viewed at an angle, and not being able to open it beyond 130 degrees forces a viewing angle that is dim.2) I've used it now for a total of about 4 hours and the browser has ""crashed"" at least a dozen times (once while typing this). The error states ""Google Chrome didn't shut down correctly"". I click ""restore"" and it comes back quickly, but sometimes not exactly where I left off.3) I use MS Outlook web app, which works great in my Chrome browser on a MicroSoft PC. But the Chromebook browser does not seem to handle email preview pane or multiple views of the calendar (only one day, no week or month view). I expected the Chromebook browser be as feature rich as the Chrome browser for a MS PC.UPDATE: The browser crashed frequently, so I updated to the development level for the operating system. This got rid of the crashes for one day, but the next day the Chromebook would not turn on (screen was black). I like the concept, but I am returning the unit and will wait another 6 months or year until the bugs are worked out.

Performed a factory reset on the chromebook (even though it was brand new) and touchpad started working.  Touchpad worked for about 3 weeks and then stopped again.  Searching online I found this to be an ongoing issue with these units.  If using an external mouse it was great.  I really liked the design and was satisfied with the speed and performance. However, the touchpad issues are a dealbreaker.

It works for very basic functions like email and internet browsing , any other thing like downloading pictures from my Iphone or registering a GPS with the factory I could not do. I think Google created the Chrome OS and them forgot it . The Chrome application store is confusing and the business partner they choose for the microsoft compatible Apps Zoho , is the most complicated company I've ever seen . Keep it s it is , forget the apps.

1135,"Okay, maybe I should give this review some more time, you know? Because when I researched buying a laptop I noted how long the person had the thing. For me it's been less than a week. But can I say that I am loving this bad boy?I am far from the type of person who can come on here and say all this technical gibberish but as a 40-something woman who wanted an alternative to sharing computers at the library, as well as work on my novel at home OFFLINE, I must say that I am pleased as punch.The main concern for me was multitasking. I have undiagnosed ADD so I am usually opening three windows or more at one time and going back and forth. It's not my scene to do one thing at one time. So when I first tested this puppy out at a cafe, I was relieved that it seemed to allow me to play Youtube and blog at the same time. That first day I tested the WIFI at several locations (I choose not to get Internet service at home so I'm not online 24/7/365). It was choppy to have the video going while I was posting elsewhere. That was a bit of a bummer however I have made peace with it. I mean, the keyboard is SPRINGY! I love how my fingers fly and there is such responsiveness. Don't believe anyone who says anything negative about the keyboard. Apparently there has been a slight change in some of the keys. For instance, there is no cap lock. But do you really use that feature all the time? I guess if you like to shout but come on...I will post an update in several weeks to say how well the offline Google Docs deal is going. Until then...happy blogging!

1137,"After more than a year with a Chromebook, it had become increasingly clear that while it's certainly inexpensive it has way too many limitations to name.I reset my Google password today.  As a result, I shockingly lost my entire downloads folder, a year's worth of files.  When I spoke to Chromebook tech support, all I got was ""yes, someone else called with that issue today"" followed by, ""sorry, your files are gone and cannot be retrieved.""  You should be saving your files to your Google Drive, she then instructed.  Wow. Completely unacceptable and unrepentant reply on so many levels.I expected far more from Google. I am retiring my Chromebook, and it won't have come soon enough.

1143,"*UPDATE*  NETFLIX WORKS 5/5 stars now!this is essentially a netbook running a wifi based operating system with ""apps"" basically being bookmarks that open tabs for websites.That's it!You won't find much functionality without wifi.  If you are in a place without wifi and have a little tech skill you should be able to set up your phone as a wifi hotspot.  I have even found a way to tether/hotspot my galaxy note 2 with sprint without having to enable the option through them(who likes paying for functionality you should have for free right?)So you have to be in a wifi area or be willing to tether your book to your phone.This Chromebook uses the ARM based processor so NETFLIX, HULU and Amazon Streaming do not yet work.If you want those to work out of the box you will be better off going with the Acer C7 which runs an Intel processor with a little more pep and support for those services at the expense of a warmer running temperature and a shorter battery life.My mom has the Acer C7 and loves it.These little laptops are for web browsing 95% of the time, you can play flash games easy enough and write emails and use evernote or google docs to type things up if you really need to.  You can even set up a printer really easily.  It does take a little getting used to though working settings through a chrome tab.I like having an extremely portable device to mess with.That said, I do still use a Toshiba 13"" laptop and a Gaming PC.  This won't replace those entirely.  This is good for the bedroom really.  Sitting with it on your lap for 4 hours reading the news, emailing friends, checking amazon, updating facebook or twitter.It's simple, cheap and I love it.  Oh and it doesn't support a ton of video formats so don't expect it to be used for a lot of video watching.  Encode things in MP4 if you really want to watch them.

I provide tech training services and wanted to add Chrome OS to my repertoire of services offered.Received the Chromebook and setup was a breeze. Imported my bookmarks, made configurations. The display was exceptional -- bright, glare free and easy to read. Build quality was very good for the price. Keyboard and trackpad were nearly Apple quality. I used and enjoyed the Chromebook for 3 days and then there was an auto update and everything went to hell. Wifi would connect and drop within a few seconds, then the process would repeat continually. Contacted support which took 3 days for a response (too long). Response was that they were aware of the issue and there was no timeframe for resolution, so back it goes for refund.The unit itself was very good, and the cloud computing system of Chrome OS offered good functionality. However, the update wifi issue, and time it took Google support to respond, lead me to believe it is not ready for wide use and I could not, in good conscience, recommend this system to my clients.I will try a Chromebook again in 6-12 months to see if the system has developed to solid reliability.

With everything on the cloud, I don't have to worry about losing precious data if it were to break in the future. Not having the ability to install 10 million windows applications, great.

1148,"I know that I am not the right type of user for ChromeOS. I want to be able to do programming and use Firefox and Opera.Why did I buy the Samsung Chromebook XE303C12? For the dual-core ARM CPU and because of the price ($250), with the hope that it will soon become easy to install a good Linux distro onto the internal SSD (eMMC).It *can* be done now using chroot, but it's a tricky procedure. The best options are i) ""Crouton"", a chroot of Ubuntu, or ii) Arch Linux for Arm CPU in a chroot. The Crouton LXDE installation is complete and very light. The user switches between LXDE and Chrome OS using a key-combination. The Arch chroot is minimal and the user doesn't leave Chrome OS. There is an editor for Chrome called ""Text"" that can edit and save local files.The XE303C12 is no X series Thinkpad (the best portable), but the keyboard, screen, ARM CPU and price make it far better than any netbook.NOTE: The keyboard has no Delete key. It's an Apple-style backspace key. To get the behaviour of the Delete key, type ALT+BACKSPACE.**EIGHT MONTHS LATER**Chromebooks are the evolution of netbooks and this is a better productivity tool than a tablet. Very important in my household is that the Chromebook runs Flash without fiddling. I have used ""Crouton"" to install Ubuntu LTS 12.04 with LXDE and I am pleased by the ability to do serious work in the chroot and switch nimbly back to ChromeOS for online work.

The screen is small and sometimes hard to see.  The touchpad is sometimes a little too sensitive and it could use more USB ports and an Ethernet port.

1158,"I have had the chromebook for approximately 9 months.  I bought it for 2 purposes.  The first is that I used to travel often, and it was absolutely the perfect size for travel.  I could take it on an airplane easily, and I loved the offline features.  The second purpose was for graduate school.  I didn't want to shell out the money for a full laptop to take back to school, but I wanted one that would do what I needed it to.  This is perfect for school.  I can take notes, I can use the internet, and google drive is possibly the best thing to ever happen to me (that may be a slight exaggeration, but I'm going for emphasis here.)  While I had google drive before, I find myself using it for everything now.  I can download docs in microsoft format on a school computer when I need to print something, I send in a different format, and I can pull it up on my ipad or phone.  (Yes, I do realize that this portion of the review is focused more on google drive than the chromebook itself, but you really don't realize how much you'll use google docs until you purchase a chromebook).My two complaints about the chromebook are1)  the battery life does begin to diminish fairly quickly.  When I first bought it, I got 6 hours easily from one charge.  I've still had it less than a year, and I'm down to 4ish hours of battery.  Now, that's still A LOT.  So I'm not entirely complaining about it.  But I am worried that if this is a pattern, the battery life will be pretty small in the future.  Since I am using this for class, 4+ hours of battery life is a must.2)  I am finding that my chromebook has a much more difficult time finding wifi networks that it already knows.  This sounds weird...but it really will take a long time to connect to the wifi.  It will find other networks, but when I open my laptop up in the morning, sometimes it takes 5-10 minutes to find the home network.  When I go to the local coffee shop that I frequent, it sometimes won't find the network at all.  This is HUGELY frustrating to me.  I'm not a techie, so I don't know if there's something I'm doing wrong, but having chatted with another chromebook owner, I found that they've had this happen to them as well.  So clearly there is a small issue there.Overall, I like my chromebook.  I would buy it again, and I would recommend it to others.  Sure, it has it's problems that others have mentioned, such as the netflix issue and inability to add applications, but it's a netbook!  I'm not expecting the capabilities of a full laptop.  If that's what you want, shell out the money for one.  Otherwise, buy one of these and you will be fairly happy with the simplicity and effectiveness of it.

You don't ever worry about annoying errors, or software upgrades. Every user is confined to their own log in, and one user can not affect the other. Google has also built in security features where the entire system is backed up internally and verified on each boot, so if you fail verification due to some strange bug or virus it will automatically restore your OS to the known good backup.This is a great idea from Google and I'm glad to see if finally catching on in the market.

In fact, I will not purchase another Samsung product until the company acknowledges that the problem with their screens cracking under normal use is a defect, and not the result of misuse.  I purchased my first Chromebook for my daughter last Christmas.  In terms of functionality, it was exactly what we expected.  Eight months later, the screen developed a crack.  I read about this problem on several review sites, and also read that Samsung was not acknowledging that this was a problem with the product.  Since I had purchased the Square Trade warranty with the first machine, I went ahead and used that to replace the Chromebook.  Less than three weeks later, the second machine developed a crack in the screen.  This time I did go through the process with Samsung's customer service and sent the machine to Texas to have it evaluated.  As expected, that company (Intelisol) stated that the cracked screen would not be covered under warranty.  I want to make it clear that neither machine was subject to any rough handling or extreme conditions.  The screen cracks under NORMAL use.  Yes, I only paid $250 for the Samsung product, but I bought it under the reasonable expectation that it would function well for at least a year under normal conditions.  I will not throw $250 away again.  For that matter, I will not throw away the $50 it would cost to replace the screen (a product that is now available on Amazon, by the way).  There is no reason to believe that the new screen won't crack just as easily as the first two did.

1184,"First impressions are definately good. I received this Chromebook in the mail yesterday and started my set up last night.PRO's:Very lightweight, clean lines, easy keyboard functions, not too small, not too big. Easy to use. Has walk throughs and free goodie bundles that you could qualify for based on the model Chromebook. There are many accessories you can purchase for it. I linked my Google account with it and it pulled all my internet history and favorites... that was creepy... also linked my printer with the google cloud and printed a few things. Checked out my google docs and did a few walk throughs how to use the Google Docs and upload them to the cloud. Very cool.The only thing I am worried about is if the Google Docs will be compatable with my kids school for his school work. If not he will be printing it first I guess.CON's:Cant download itunes on it so I cannot link my iphone...So far, thats it. I will update as I use it more often.

1185,"I purchased the Chromebook for my 13 year old at Christmas. Most of my child's electronic life is hosted in the cloud so I thought this would be a natural fit.

Bright and Clear screen, first time use i obtained 10 hrs of battery life!!Recommend you read completely what this little chromebook offers before purchasing, it is perfect for my needs.,The keyboard is large along with a nice size touchpad, similar to a regular laptop. It takes a Logitech Mouse with no problem. Hopefully more downloads will be available in the future. It comes with many apps which i have not reviewed yet.. Alas, no Delete button but you get use to the backspacing...All in All Fun and Fast!!

1193,"My Samsung Google Chromebook arrived today, 2 days after ordering with Prime. A few initial reactions...Very easy to get going out of the box,even easier if you have a google account and are familiar with Google Docs and android apps. I loved the small size and minimal weight, however the plastic case is just that, not very substantial plastic.I sure would not want to drop it or crush it in a suitcase or carry on. I'm not sure it would be good or a child unless there was some kind of and otter box-like case to protect it. Don't think it would hold up to kid abuse for the long haul.I bought a royal blue neoprene sleeve with some side pockets that fits well and will hold the charging cord.I bought the Chromebook mostly for ease when traveling. I do have an ipad3 that I love, but wanted a more windows oriented option as well. My at home laptop is a DELL Inspiron, but it is a desktop replacement 17"" and way too big and heavy to take on a trip.The touchpad is adequately responsive, the desktop is uncluttered...it's easy.Uncomplicated. Functional.I already liked the Chrome Browser and enjoy using gmail .Using it is like working with a friend you know well.The charging plug is as ridiculous as others have reviewed. What in the world was Samsung thinking when they designed a dongle thingy that looks like it plugs in to my electric stapler. One will need to be VERY careful when plugging it in and out of the little plug port in the back.The chromebook came partially charged and got to full capacity very quickly.So far so good when using this little guy. It seems to do what I want it to do, is tiny, has good screen resolution, good keyboard action except my ""f"" key sticks and does not react immediately when pushed. I'm debating if I want to send it back for that, it does slow me down when I type, and have to stop and think about if the ""f"" printed. Very annoying. Hoping it will loosen up and work like the other keys. I do like the keyboard action overall.I read all the reviews about this machine before I ordered it and I'm beginning to think there are some people who just dream up negative reviews to stir things up...One person said, no delete key....uhh, what's wrong with the backspace for that? There is also a keyboard shortcut that takes the place of a cap lock but I will have to go back in and figure out where those keyboard shortcuts are again..So my reaction is mixed, but leaning more towards the positive..some people are expecting a finely crafted laptop for this low low price. You get what you pay for, but in this case, the low price buys you the a basic machine, created with a great deal of thought about the features. I will update my review as time goes on. I am hoping I will not have function failure as others have reviewed after using for awhile. The sticking ""f"" key is really, really annoying.UPDATE #1: Spent a lot of time using the Chromebook last night and have decided the sticking ""f"" key is not something I can live with. So I am exchanging it for another one. Amazon customer returns NEVER disappoints...the return process is beyond easy. The CS representative was friendly and helpful, and easy to understand as English was her primary language, unlike most other CS online experiences I'm encountering lately for other companies. Amazon will overnight ship a replacement Chromebook at no cost to me, and will email me a return label also at no cost to ship the package back. And, they are not waiting for the defective item to arrive before sending the new one. What's not to love about Amazon? Seriously...Also noticed that in the advanced Chromebook settings, there is a way to ""wipe"" the machine back to factory settings. I really appreciate how basically user friendly this machine seems to be. Not quite the same as an apple device, they practically reach thru the display and guide your hand to what you want to do, but easy...one of the reasons I did not want a small windows laptop or netbook was how unintuitive it is to do what you need to do even for simple setting changes or adjustments. I find myself totally frustrated when I go back to using my DELL laptop after my Ipad because of the Windows platform with a million windows to click through. I'm glad Google has come up with what I hope continues to be a very respectable alternate for basic functions (please, I'm not a tekkie so don't jump on this, want a small basic machine that won't get bogged down with the issues a Windows machine experiences) I'm hoping I can also use Chromebook away from my home wifi, using my iphone as a hotspot so I can take advantage of using the internet on a larger display. Originally I had an android smart phone, a samsung galaxy Fascinate with a nice large display. I switched to an iphone 4 and was not thrilled with the small screen, even though I like most everything else. I've really wrestled with the decision to switch back to either a samsung NOTEII or GalaxyIII  for a larger screen, but now with the Chromebook tethered to my own hotspot,I'm rethinking that.Yes, it will use data, but I don't stream music, play games or videos on 3g data so I end up with more than enough data each month(Verizon) Will update again next month unless there are ""issues"" with the new machine.Update #2 April 13, 2013: My replacement Chromebook arrived yesterday as promised with overnight delivery. No problems with the keyboard keys sticking as I experienced with the first one. Fast set up again out of the box. First interesting observation,no juice...I had to charge it right away...the first Chromebook arrived with a partial charge..hmmmm...with first one thought, ""oh, thoughtful to have that ready to go"" Now thinking it was returned by someone else for the sticking f key. It charges quickly so not really a problem, plugged in (again, silly little charging dongle) and went thru set up, choosing my wireless connection. First hiccup, the wireless kept going off, trying to default to neighbors' appearing in the list...this did not happen the first time...Re-booted, and wireless was OFF again.Connected, but didn't stay connected. Starting to worry. I am not tech trained, but I do know some things. Clicked on the wireless icon and went into the wireless settings and saw that the box for ""automatically connect to this network"" was UNCHECKED. Another hmmm, first machine, that had no wireless staying on issues was NOT a new one when it came to me. Selected that option, now problem solved (I think) I shut the machine down  and came back to it awhile later, internet defaulted to my home connection right away A few things I don't know how to do, maybe someone else can help me, don't know how to get rid of APPS that I downloaded from the chrome store and,I chose several new themes, told me they were added, but I can't find them to select them...where did they go? After being used to the Ipad retina display, I agree that the resolution is underwhelming and increasing the brightness does help.Realistic expectations as we all have said, is the key to enjoying this machine.I'm still concerned that overtime,the Chrmbk will start having problems as noted in other reviews. I don't forsee heavy usage, wanted this machine as a low cost mini laptop traveling companion to my ipad3 and didn't want another tablet(android)So, the jury's still out. Added a 4th star because right now there is nothing to fault and I think performance is more than just mediocre if you accept it for what it is. I'm hopeful I didn't get one of the ""lemons"". We'll see how it goes over time.Update #3  May 2. Love using the Chromebook for Internet browsing and email. It is SO FAST on startup and battery life is exceptional. It also automatically converted an excel spreadsheet to chrome's equivalent..I have had no issues with it thus far, but it doesn't get sustained, hard use. I was able to pair it with both my printers, one HP eprint and a canon, thru the cloud..what more could I need?! I will be traveling with it mid month but don't expect any issues.Update #4 June 1st. Traveled with the Chromebook, no issues, was able to attach to new wireless connections without a problem. Back home and Still using it happily with no issues...the simplicity of it is what makes it so useful. Grab and get on. I needed to use my 17"" Dell laptop this weekend and there were frequent browser crashes, and it is just not intuitive to use when you get used to the Chromebook and an ipad. Wish the resolution could be a litle sharper, but as I have said in the past...low price, low expectations = satisfaction. If I want to see a stunning pix of something I can grab my ipad. Overall I believe this is a very useful machine if you don't bend the parameters!Update#5 July 6, 2013  still find great utility and versatility in the Chromebook. Have had no issues, have no buyer's regret. So glad to avoid the numerous ""issues"" that always arise when using my dell laptop, which has been updated and tuned up recently. I want to repeat,IMO, this machine is a SUPPLEMENT to having both a full featured Windows laptop and an Ipad3. I do not think you will be satisfied with it if it is your only computer. Not at this level Chromebook. But for my needs and the way I continue to use it, it has been perfect. Two new observations: it gets quite warm with prolonged use, but I have never had it shut down for overheating. I don't believe it has an internal fan. And, if using on your lap like I was this am enjoying coffee out on my lanai, the speakers get muffled a bit since they are located in the front underside corners...in the lid or above the keyboard would be better. When you are using the laptop on a solid surface, the non slip buttons in the four corners raise it up enough to leave the speakers unencumbered. The biggest negative I have found is the lack of a cap lock. There IS a keyboard shortcut for that, and I can never remember what it is without continually looking it up! Most of the time I just hold the shift button down and type what I need in boldface with one hand...but deciding not to include that is semi annoying from time to time. Know nothing about using it for ITUNES, videos, etc. I would think you could do videos,both live streaming and downloaded and since I am totally untalented with itunes, I only use my windows laptop when I ATTEMPT to sync music, usually unsuccessfully.

The automatic save feature is great, and it's good to know that one's work is saved in the cloud and can be accessed from any computer.The Chromebook is simple to transport, and its long hours of saved battery time make it easy to take various places in your home or  other locations without the need to keep it plugged in or charged.I would recommend the Chromebook for writers and students and businessmen on the move.

But if that's all you need, it's perfect.  95% of the time, if I have need for a laptop away from home, I'm either browsing the internet or using a word processor.  The Chromebook gives me those two things (and a little more) in a light-weight, sturdy frame with a large keyboard.  Even if you own a powerful laptop, this serves a purpose for everyday, non-specialized use, and less worry about damaging or losing your more expensive laptop.

1201,"The screen is washed out, the sound is terrible, and the keyboard is awkward.  On top of that the build quality, durability of it is quite bad.  Don't buy this if you plan to watch a lot of videos.  I'd say it's good for web browsing, and that's about it.  If you have low expectations I think you will be satisfied.  An alternate to this if you want a better screen would be a tablet.  The specifications should be very similar just minus an attached keyboard.  In hind site I think I would have bought a galaxy tablet and just get one of those add on keyboards.  I recommend considering that idea before buying this, unless you've used it somewhere else and know exactly what you are getting.  With all said, it still does as advertised.  A better name would be ""The Samsung Netbook by Google- featuring Chrome OS"".  With that there would be no confusion for future owners and perhaps people less informed.

1202,"Nice way to access Google Chrome.  Inexpensive device we keep out of site in our living area.  It totally met my expectations, which are in line for the type of device it is.The big downside is the AC adapter plug which connects the power  in the backside of the Chromebook.  We've had the device well over a month now.  When first inspecting the power connector I was concerned that the male charging pin was extremely small in diameter.  Today, I noticed that the pin was bent from normal use and abuse.  I've straightened it, and it still works, but I doubt this connector will last very long.To circumvent future damage, I'll not keep the pin connected when storing the Chromebook in the (optional) folio.  I imagine the adapter pin was bent while stored in the case?For the price, the chromebook is a great ""web checking"" device.  I'll follow up in a year or so for a ""durability"" update.

1203,"I wanted a portable device that I could use for business and for personal entertainment.  A device with a keyboard was a must have because I generate and revise lots of emails and documents for work.  Tablets just do not get the job done for me and a laptop can be too cumbersome and heavy or slow when traveling or meeting with clients.I have been using Google Apps a lot for personal use and, more recently, I have been using Google Apps more for my business.  I even started using Google Docs, Sheets, etc. to replace Microsoft Office.  There are also many other apps that I use in my business that integrate very well with Google (HelloSign, Evernote, etc.).The Chromebook is fast, it starts up in seconds.  That makes it great for client meetings.  When there is no WiFi available, I simply tether the Chromebook to my Google Nexus 4 mobile phone.  The Chromebook display is nice, the speakers are good and the keyboard is sufficient for lots of typing, though not as good as a traditional laptop.  I recently jumped into cloud computing and I am now running an almost completely paperless business.  This Chromebook perfectly suits my needs.If you love Google Apps and you are looking for a portable device that can be used for work and for personal entertainment, this is it.

Unless your eyesight is good to excellent, you cannot read it.This is an old problem and frankly it's getting old and annoying that people keep complaining about the unchangeable small font on their browser, and their Chromebooks, and Google is not even bothering to address the problem.Come on, Google, not all of us can read that tiny, 6pt print!That aside, I spoke via email several times to the seller, Chinajoekim.

This allows me to use applications offline such as LibreOffice, GIMP, Apache web server, OpenShot video editor, and many others.  On boot-up I have the option of selecting the Ubuntu operating system (in this case on an SDHC card) or continuing to ChromeOS.  It took several hours to troubleshoot the installation of Ubuntu 13.04, though 12.04 (which I installed first) installed smoothly.  In a few months the problems may be resolved, and there will probably be a well-established path to installing Ubuntu 13.04.  I chose 13.04 because it is receiving more attention from the developers, particularly with support for hardware video acceleration.I also noticed that 720p video with H.264 in the ChromeOS environment is not entirely smooth, but still very watchable.  What a great little laptop at 2.4 pounds, no heat, no fan to make noise, no hard drive to complain when you move it, and 6+ hours battery life!Edit: I measured the battery runtime at 5 hours 20 minutes from unplug to shutdown in Ubuntu as described.  The shutdown came as a surprise since the battery level indicator was not updating.  I was doing light web browsing, wifi on, bluetooth off, optical wired mouse, no dimming of the display, or any other power management as far as I can tell.  No doubt ChomeOS with its power management features will provide longer runtime.

1228,"Was excited about this solution to something in between a tablet and a laptop - wanted something with super long battery life, light enough I could forget about it in my bag, and that had a good size keyboard for writing on at length.The gripes were that I lost all the writing I did one night after the battery died - about five hours of writing was gone. Maybe I did something wrong or should've backed it up, but it was my first time using it. Since then I've used it 2 or 3 times and had a thumb drive handy, but it wasn't a good match for me, between trying to figure out how to log in when I had no net connection, to not having a full version of Word, etc.Again - willing to taking my hits on this review if those were learning curve issues I should blame myself for rather than Chromebook. I am a big fan of android and most my devices are Samsung these days (were mostly apple, sony, etc., before), but this didn't cut it for me and I'm back to my laptop, Samsung and ipad tabs.

1232,"i think this is a good and innovative laptop like computer.I have a Samsung cellphone and it is reliable and well made. This chrome laptop like gadget looks like it is well made and of good quality materials, one glaring defect is a lack of a delete key and an end key, so if your cursor is before a letter that you want to delete one has to  move the cursor after the letter so one can use the backspace key to delete.I also think that the lack of availability of commonly used programs in the cloud part of this gadget, will make this less competitive to someone who can supply that service.Another complaint about this laptop like computer,is the difference in the price between the 3g and the wifi model.The  price is over a hundred dollars for 2 years of 3g service. I think that people like me who uses only 3g service when outside the range of my wifi will select a model with 3g service for the life of the gadget.I think that this  product is not yet perfect so i give it 4 stars.

My Dell 17"" laptop is just too big to carry around, and if lost or damaged, irreplaceable with all my files on it. Those 7"" and 8"" tablets are just too small for my eyesite. The 10"" ones are more expensive than the Chromebook which has an 11.6"" screen (diagonally measured). Chromebook comes with a keyboard, touchpad, and USB ports for flashdrives and adding a wireless mini mouse. It's extremely light weight, very thin, and because it's a notebook design, the screen won't get damaged tossing it and carrying it in a backpack. Chromebook starts up and connects in seconds. Had no problem connecting to my home router. Keys are oversized for big fingers like mine. Options allow me to increase the screen view to 125-150% which I need for my bad eyesite. In outside light, the screen is very readable.  Only not so great thing to say about Chromebook is the USB ports and power cord connection on the rear instead of the sides.

SD card sticks out when installed. Can't disable the fullscreen reminder when you get too close to the top of the screen. A few of the chrome tools don't work on the ARM processor, yet. Downward facing speakers don't work well in my lap.Things I don't worry about: Doesn't run windows, mac, or linux programs. Webcam is so-so. Screen viewing angle is not very wide.

Granted if you are a gamer thus requiring high performance graphics this is not a laptop for you.

For about two years now I have used Google docs exclusivity for all my office needs.  Also, if you need to share what you are working on with someone using Office, you can export and import from Office to Google docs.  The best part is Google docs is free... with Microsoft you have to play for Office, Windows, plus the cost of a more expensive computer, which will be outdated in 3 years.

I like the size, layout and feel of the Samsung keyboard which makes emails and other typing tasks much easier. These Chromebooks start up faster than I can turn on my wifi mouse after opening the Chromebook case! Movies and video like Youtube run smooth and do not buffer. The built in speakers are pretty good but earphones are of course much better.I believe this Chromebook is going to be one of my favorite devices as it just feels right and will be a great travel computer without the bulk and expense of a full blown laptop.

1303,"*Updated 1/28/14-- added, updated, and streamlined content*I bought this in a hurry when my old Dell laptop died right before school started and this was all I could afford. It's worth what I paid, which is to say it's not worth a lot, but it works. Altogether, it's fine, but I wouldn't buy it again if I had the money to buy a non-Chromebook. I knew I'd suffer a little for the Chrome OS, but I didn't realize just how much because I'm not tech-savvy. I find it's pretty limited in what it can do (especially regarding schoolwork) but it covers the essentials acceptably, which is really all I should expect from a $220 machine.Pros:-The lack of startup time is fantastic! Being able to open it up and have it going in 10 seconds is really, really great. I was used to taking 5+ minutes just to get on my e-mail with my old dying Dell laptop.-Lightweight and sleek; easy to transport; great for bringing to class-good battery life-questionably powerful enough for my needs, but not for my wants (see below)-durable (?)Cons:-After almost 6 months of use, the performance seems to be getting progressively worse. When I first got it, things ran amazingly smoothly. I could have 8 tabs open (facebook, Youtube in the background, a document, buzzfeed articles queued up) and nothing would stutter and it all loaded quickly. Not anymore. Even simple pages can take forever to load. Sometimes, it works perfectly fine and other times, it's hardly functional. Closing superfluous tabs doesn't help-- it can run just as slow on a single pdf as it does with 7 buzzfeed articles open. I have these problems both running it on my home internet and school internet. Ultimately, the internet always works but it's just ridiculously slow sometimes. I would summarize the performance as being wildly inconsistent.-It seems to run worse when it's not plugged in.-Google Docs is awful on in its own right and the machine can barely run it. It stutters incessantly (possibly due to the constant auto-saving?) and it's basically impossible to make a well-organized, attractive document in Docs on a Chromebook. Skydrive (online MS Office) is not much better considering the Chrome OS limitations and the auto-saving. In either of these word processors, the lag is unbearable. If I need to type more than one page, it's literally less of a hassle for me to travel to school/stay later to do assignments than it is to produce them on the Chromebook. I have a >50-page document due at the end of every semester and I would rather eat my own tongue than attempt to even OPEN it on my Chromebook, let alone type it up.-Don't even get me started on opening/trying to edit MS Word docs on a Chromebook. It opens in a program called QuickOffice which is awful. Documents are ugly and the formatting is ruined. Normally crashes if I try to edit them. One time, it crashed every time I hit the left shift key. Other times (95% of the time), it just crashes out of nowhere.-You cannot use any Apple or Microsoft software. Considering that the world runs on these companies, this is a MAJOR drawback of the Chromebook. I had no idea it'd be this inconvenient. I can't use my school-specific software, watch some required videos, run some required software,or create and/or reasonably edit MS Office things.-On that note, you need an app for EVERYTHING. If it's not a website, you probably need an app.-The plastic shell feels kind of flimsy, especially around the trackpad. Sitting it on top of soft things (ex your knee, laptop sleeve) seems to screw up clicking-- almost like you could click by pressing on the underside of the shell under the trackpad. If you press on the shell next to the trackpad, you can see the whole keyboard rock. Still, like I said above, it does seem durable. Honestly, I've been known to slam the heel of my hand down on the trackpad/hand rest part when I get upset and it hasn't shown any signs of wear and tear. After almost 6 months, the plastic casing on the back of the keyboard part, like where all the ports are, is coming off. It clicks back on but I'm afraid of that the consequence will be if I can't put it back on someday. I've never dropped this thing or banged it off something, so I don't know why it's coming off.-It sometimes ignores my clicks? I feel like sometimes (by that I mean daily, just not every time) I have to click on things multiple times in order for the Chromebook to register it. No signs of loading, etc-- just it acting as if I never clicked at all.So, in summary, I wouldn't buy this Chromebook again if I had other options, but it'll do until I can afford to replace it with a Windows machine. It just doesn't cut it for my schoolwork and it isn't even good for entertainment. It works but not really that well. It does what I absolutely, bottom-line NEED it to do, but it doesn't do it how I want or expect it to. I would say it's like a splint when what I really need is a cast. In a pinch, it's much better than nothing but it's just not sufficient in the long run.

1305,"Many of the reviews here are as much about the Chrome OS as they are about the Samsung Chromebook. This is understandable given that encountering a cloud-based system for the first time is a somewhat novel and perhaps daunting experience. But not for me. I am/was one of the original beta testers of the Chrome OS and received my mysterious little Cr-48 machine unannounced from Google a little over 2.5 years ago. Together, the Cr-48 and me, we spent those years on the chrome dev channel swatting bugs and testing features. As a result I am as firm a Chrome OS advocate as you are likely to find not working for Google.But alas, my wheezy, unsupported little prototype finally gave up the ghost and I went shopping. Last Christmas I gave this exact model (Samsung 303C) to my dad as a gift (replacing an archaic Windows 98 monstrosity) but spent no real time on it other than a little bit of setup. After my box died I borrowed it back for a few days and was sold. Miles ahead of the initial hardware. Great keyboard, sensitive touch pad and everything works as advertised. The ARM processor is very responsive with the lightweight OS. If it were possible to do some sort of quality/price ratio on laptops I am confident this Samsung would be at or near the top of any unbiased list. The Amazon sales figures might partially confirm this.So, first do your homework and know exactly what the Chrome OS is and isn't and the changes in your computing habits that may be necessary. If you're still willing to take the plunge, I highly recommend this machine as a place to start...

1309,"In my opinion the Chromebook's premise is good.  It is a very light and fast OS and you don't have worry about buying and downloading an anti-virus and/or programs such as Microsoft Office.  Google docs and the other pre-installed software from Google will do the job for most people I think,  except maybe power users.  The Chrome web store is getting better each day and with the frequent updates and the new packaged apps that work offline this OS seems to be showing more promising each day.  The keyboard and track pad are really great and although the computer itself is made out of plastic is feels like it is of better quality.  The downside to this computer is that if you are not a fan of Google's services than it can be frustrating because you cannot download applications from other competing companies such as Itunes or Internet Explorer or Firefox.  For now you are mostly stuck with what Google has to offer, but I think that may change if this OS really takes off which I think it will.  Also, the screen is pretty average and the processor is just ok for an ARM chip.  If you have more than 5 tabs open, performance can start to stutter.  Video playback is also an issue.  This is kind of like a hybrid computer with tablet performance but with the ability to be more productive because of the keyboard and ability to use more powerful applications than you would on a regular tablet.  For the price I think its an excellent purchase.

1330,"I've had my Chromebook for a week now. I was looking for a small laptop to take in my briefcase to work and use at home for light-weight computing. I already have a large PC laptop designed for gaming that I haul out and use every once in a while. On my desk is an apple iMac. I did not purchase the chromebook with the idea of using it to edit audio or video or play online games.So far I am very satisfied with the performance and usability. There has been a bit of a learning curve with this device. There are a number of things you cannot do with this machine that takes some adaptation on the part of the user. I'll cover those in this review.Primarily, my computing uses are: news, shopping, email, internet radio, and limited TV watching (podcast). I do not have cable-tv or satellite. So my computer is my cable-TV using Amazon Prime and other online services. I use itunes for lots of my media consumption, using the chromebook means there is no itunes, which caused a real turmoil trying to figure out how to get the same programs and keep track of what has and hasn't been watched. The substitute has been using Google Reader and subscribing to RSS feeds for the podcasts I used itunes for.I only play a couple games, one of those is a total no-go on the chromebook, which was something I knew before I purchased it.Here's what I have come up with so far about using the samsung 11.6"" $250 machine:Pros: battery life (5-6 hrs), small size and weight (similar to macbook air) ease of use - fast to start-up (mine takes about 8 seconds), Chrome is very similar to Firefox (even can add extensions like the ones I use on the imac)(ad blocker, ghostery, lastpass, downloaders,etc.) will play most media stored in the chromebook or on google drive, will support a generic wired usb mouse, decent wifi performance, screen resolution is decent but not hi-def, audio is acceptable, battery charge rate is decent, I think the unit is fairly protected against viruses but being chained to google makes you totally spied upon by our service providing overlords.Cons: Confusing settings menus (scattered here and there), lack of uniformity on using right click for some functions and in some places but not others, lack of settings (no control panels) for standard features on laptops (ex: brightness control), ear phone jack is stiff and hard to use, SD card slot leaves part of the card sticking out the side, 100gb free google drive will not authorize for some strange reason (i tried re-setting the computer back to factory settings and trying three times - same results - no response from clicking on the button to redeem the offer), waking up from sleep is sometimes a total fail requiring a re-boot, no way I can see to block obnoxious flash ads (aside from blocking the domain in your router)I'll update it after a month or so, but as of now I have no buyers remorse.FOLLOW-UP:I've had my Chromebook for almost two months now, it gets used a lot. It is not my number one choice but here are some thoughts after using it for a while:1. the biggest problem for me with this device is the lack of software that functions like Itunes. I am a cord cutter, so my source for TV and news is the internet and mostly on itunes podcasts. If you know of a way to duplicate this service please let me know. I have tried using google RSS news-reader but it is very awkward and clumsy.2. my biggest dislike is with the small screen size.3. When I need quick access to something like amazon or email and I have to turn on a computer, the fast start-up time for the chromebook is reason #1 why I use it over my windows-7 based laptop.4. I have not met anyone anywhere that has heard of Chrome OS.5. The dependence on wifi so far has not been an issue. Making the cloud storage work and understanding what I can and cannot put there is reason #1 why I doubt I would take this on a vacation with me since I need to move images/video from the camera to storage.6. The OS needs something like a control panel screen that does not configure the Chrome browser but just the hardware. I would like to see more things settable. (time-out, btry saver modes, privacy, auto-erase my browsing history, auto-erase my downloads history, etc.)7. the metal trim around the LCD display feels loose-ish and flimsy. The flat surface area on either side of the trackpad feels flimsy and sometimes creaks when my hands rest there.8. The SD card slot should allow the card to be fully inserted, leaving almost half the card sticking out is asking for a broken card/slot.9. The battery life is great, charging is fast and easy.10. Sound and images are fine.11. You know what would really be the ideal chromebook? Make this a 17 inch display with built-in wifi/3G/4G service, non-contract (virgin mobile), allowing tethering, and a micro SD card slot for added memory and this machine would be a run-away hit.2/3/13 Just got back from a trip by plane. On many previous trips I took my macbook air (MBA). I was always worried about it coming up missing after going through airport security (the thieves in the TSA). The Chromebook is much less of a target. One of the things I do with a laptop on trips is to download pictures and videos from my cameras from the card to an external USB hard drive. Just like the MBA, the chromebook worked flawlessly for this. Only snag was if I tried to watch a large video file, hi-res, it could not display the video. I also found out that moving files from one folder to another on an SD card is nearly impossible with this OS. I did make it work with a very time consuming copy and paste technique but moving them from the SD card to the USB drive was simply drag and drop.All in all, it performed well and I feel much better about bringing it through 'security theater' than I do with the MBA that is almost $1k more!I also tried using the chromebook with a large LCD tv and it looked fine. I may consider a chrome desktop if itunes becomes available online.

But, don't expect to do heavy duty word processing or spreadsheets. That is not its purpose. It is an internet interface; and for that it works well. I use it to teach an online class utilizing the BlackBoard portal, so the Chromebook works fine. Reason I bought it is so I won't have to bring my Apple MacBook Pro when I travel. If I'm prone to lose one or the other while traveling (a real possibility), I'd rather lose the Chromebook than the MacBook. You get the idea.

Not only that, but it has done so at a much cheaper price.I was able to quickly get ubuntu running (via 'Crouton' method), which opens up many possibilities to anyone with knowledge of that platform.  I am able to use the chromebook as an auxiliary browsing machine by using a freeware application called Synergy to control it over the network.  Aside from that, there are a broad array of other linux tools now available to me.Even without the ubuntu bit, the chromebook performs smoothly for web browsing, even with many tabs open.  The trackpad and keyboard perform very well and are comfortable during use (especially keyboard).  If I had to complain about anything, it would be the build quality-- if  you pick it up by a corner you can feel the flex (and sometimes hear it).  All things considered, I highly recommend this to anyone looking for the features it offers.  Do be aware, that this is NOT good if you need to run Windows or Mac based applications.

1337,"I just received my chromebook yesterday afternoon and although there is a lot different with it and a lot for me to get used to, I love it. I've recently graduated college and have a job which doesn't need me working on things outside of the web, and I rarely need to work from home anyway. All I needed was a little thing I could do some personal work with, maybe type out some personal writing, and something I could type my novel on (a personal project I'm finally getting to). This does everything I need it to and for such an understanding price. I was sold.There are a few things I'm going to need to look into, like why I can't do a mirrored screen when I hook up to my hd-tv to watch a movie, but that's not too big of an issue for me.I love this so much, especially since they've ironed out the kinks with Netflix.Seriously, to get to the bottom line of it all, I would recommend this to anyone who just needs a personal computer to mess around on. It would probably work for students too but they would have to make sure using google docs instead of office wouldn't be an issue for classes.Update: This is so far the best simple computer I've owned. I have not had any problems with this computer. The battery life is still excellent, I sit with it unplugged for hours before it warns me that there are ~15 minutes of battery life left. I power it off most nights and the start up time is still amazing, in just a couple seconds it's up and I'm signed in. There were a few instances of random shut-offs in the first few months but that was fixed with an update (updates take just a few moments too, unlike the incredibly long time system updates take on my work computer). I've traveled with this several times now and am still amazed by how light and mobile it is. I've started taking this on trips where I normally would have taken my Nexus Tablet.I've also started writing a novel and this is the only computer I'm really writing it on and everything is great. If I need to check something during my lunch break or if I get an idea sometime during the day everything is on my google drive and I can easily open up and see where I've left off.Would still highly recommend this.

That said, it does get a little warm if it's not up on it's rubber feet on a flat surface, like any electronic device.These are refreshingly simple on so many levels.It's so light, it feels like nothing in your bag.And where else can you opt for pay-as-you go 3G wireless internet (if you get the 3G model).  We did.  The included 100mb is very little for a month, might last you a few days!  ~But there's huge utility in being able to ONLY have to pre-pay for the months that we know we'll be in need of portable wireless internet access.  Otherwise we just connect to our home wireless.Enjoy.  This device is the ""Model T"" of modern computing.  It's a cheap every-man's laptop.  If it wasn't so late to the party, these would be the best answer to the complicated difficult laptops we've bought in to, ~and there would be ""one in every garage"".Enjoy!

I had ordered  a samsung chromebook for my son for christmas at the beginning of December, and it was back ordered.  I kept checking back everyday to see if it had been sent. I wasn't sure if I should cancel my order or ride it out. I decided to stay with it and keep my fingers crossed. Finally to my surprise, my chromebook was delivered Christmas Eve.  I thank amazon and all the truckers out there to make this happen!! My son loves his chromebook.

1346,"I bought one of these for my daughter, who needed an inexpensive laptop to take to school.It worked fine for a while, but was a lot slower than I had expected it to be. My daughter found it frustrating, also, to be always working ""in the cloud"". (She couldn't always get a wifi connection at school and preferred having applications and documents that were always accessible.)Anyhow, the screen cracked after only a few months. She hadn't dropped it. Apparently she closed the lid quickly once when she was in a rush. Something similar happened with another Chromebook that my son had owned previously. Anyhow, the combination of only adequate performance and less than robust design led me to get a better laptop (a Macbook) the next time around and so far it has worked perfectly.

1351,"I had no idea this was strictly a Wi-Fi based tablet/laptop. There are some application limitations based on it being strictly a Chrome OS, and the OS cannot be upgraded for use with anything Microsoft. I was pretty shocked, but you can tether it to your mobile for Wi-Fi use, and it loads really fast for anything you are using it for. If you do not have tethering capabilities or you need to take it out of the house, just know that you 'will' need a Wi-Fi connection. There are many ""Offline"" apps you can download to work with if you must leave home. It auto-saves all documents for your next Wi-Fi connection. It is customizable for your personal look and feel, but I can say I should have done better homework on the product because I cannot use it for any of the Java based web programs I need for my work-at-home jobs nor does it allow you to download Adobe Reader and some other common apps you would use with Windows OS's. It takes a little getting used to but I know I would not buy a Chrome Book again.

One disappointment is that I was unable to connect my  Phillips bluetooth external speaker to the Chromebook as  apparently it is not compatible.After researching,I found that all bluetooth keyboards and mice should work.Oddly enough my older chromebook was able to connect with bluetooth speaker.Oh well no big deal,still highly recommend for lightweight portability.This is the future of computing,did not even consider a windows laptop

Chrome OS works great, the browser is solid and works well. Occasionally it feels a tiny bit slow when you have a bunch of tabs open, but it's not intolerable.

I will grab this over my Windows 8 laptop 9 times out of 10.  I even use it to write and compile code in python, java, and ocaml and it can keep up.  My only complaint, and this is a small one, is that using linux, a lot of programs aren't compiled for ARM so it runs into compatibility issues there, but you should really be aware of this going in, if you're interested in putting linux on it anyway.  I recommend Chromebooks any time someone asks me about them.Exactly what it says, know what you're buying. Great product. Fast, portable, powerful. Decent battery life ~6 hours.

The tolerance and mfg components might not be up to APPLE standards; however, the battery life, screen, keyboard and speed - along with the functionality - are ALL there.When used for our 10 year old's homework, logging into her school for text books, etc. - nothing could be better.

I do have concerns that it seems the materials are not too substantial...we will see how the Chromebook wears over time.  I do think it is a plus that it is so lightweight yet at the same time I am concerned that a button or two on the keyboard may pop out or wearout over time.  Hopefully, my concerns will be for naught!  I have encountered little issues with the Chrome OS...mostly, just adjusting to differences between Chrome OS and Windows.  So I am satisfied...and some of these major issues that others have reviewed about happening to them have NOT been my case.

As long as you are aware of its limitations (can't install anything, mostly based on the cloud), it is a very good choice. I use this for web browsing and listening to the radio/music in our kitchen. I don't use it as my primary machine but I think it would be a good substitute for more expensive tablets (especially if you want a physical keyboard, which I really like on the Chromebook).My only beef would be that I have yet to find a way for two separate Google accounts to coexist on the machine at the same time. My wife has Gmail and I have a Google calendar and Docs and I have yet to find a way where she can quickly log in to check her email without logging me out of my Google account.

1378,"Not a laptop replacement...but then again, I don't think any real Chromebook user would ever assert something so bold. However, I can definitely say that I now spend ~80% of my computing time on my Chromebook. It's fast, lightweight, and long-lasting (battery wise). Considering that most of us now spend most of our time using the computer to use the internet, why wouldn't I use my Chromebook? I still chuckle at people who cry out ""BUT IT CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITHOUT THE INTERNETS!"" Let's be honest: how often do you use your computer for non-internet related things? That's right. I thought so. Take that, average computer user.So yes, I really do love my Chromebook. I don't regret my purchase at all. $250 was a steal for this product, as far as I'm concerned (and I'm a broke college student). It was especially vital in allowing me to successfully write my ~100pg undergraduate thesis, as the portability allowed me to work everywhere (my room, Starbucks, friends' rooms, library, professor's office, etc.).Cons: Yes, there are a few downsides. (1) Build quality is shoddy. Which I guess is a given, given the price. The paint is starting to come off, especially near where I rest my wrists. I also make sure to pick it up carefully, as the base feels a little 'loose' and I worry that it could split in half. I recommend closing and picking it up when you have to do so.(2) Ram. Yup, I'm still spoiled by laptop/desktop usage. The Chromebook definitely can't handle 50 open tabs without freezing/crashing. There is occasional lag depending on the intensity of whatever you're trying to run.Overall: A+ would recommend. Cheap laptop supplement. Google is great about pushing out frequent Chrome OS updates, and it's safe to say that my device runs even better than it did when I first got it. I'll also add that I love not having to worry about it getting stolen- All my stuff is in the cloud and can be instantly restored to a new device!

1384,"The Samsung Chromebook itself works well and is reasonably responsive for light to moderate internet use. But its instructions say you cannot print by plugging your printer into one of the two USB ports. If you have a printer with the Google Cloud Print feature, you are in good shape. I do not. I could make it print only by routing the print order through a Windows laptop, which then sent it to the printer. Quite cumbersome and a hassle to set up. All 3 devices are in a wireless network.Follow0up comment regarding Chrome Remote Desktop app: The Chromebook advises (as of 1/30/13) to ""stay tuned"" for an important feature of Remote Desktop -- the ability to access the Chromebook desktop from a remote PC or Mac. So you're out of luck for an unknown amount of time if you want to provide a little tech support to a friend or relative by taking control of their Samsung Chromebook remotely. This is a pain and a huge and unexpected disappointment. Also, TeamViewer, a free remote access program, doesn't run on the Chrome OS, so it's no help in this situation either.

It doesn't use the Microsoft office suite, which is annoying, but that information is shared in advance and google documents can be saved in Microsoft format for others to view.  Google files are saved automatically and, like I said, it's pretty fast.  I haven't had problems with too many windows open and corresponding speed problems.

If you are going to purchase the Chromebook you must consider that for the device to be usable you must have a wireless Internet connection.  The more accustomed you are to google's services the more you will get out of the device.  So if you use gmail, google drive, google docs and everything else google the device is great.  If you want to write a Python script, bring up a command line terminal or analyze a packet capture, buy something else.

1393,"I really did like the samsung chromebook I purchased, but unfortunately I had to send it in for service and the company Samsung uses for repairs is not qualified to do the work.  I did not know it at the time, but there was liquid damage to my chromebook so the repairs were not covered by the warranty.  When I asked what the cost would be to repair I was told I would have to pay a $50 fee for an evaluation, which would be applied to repairs if I opted to have it fixed.  The repair estimate came in at over $353, I only paid $269 for the chromebook brand new, most of which was for parts.  Really, why in the world would anyone pay that instead of just buying new again?  I told them to not fix it and had it sent back to me because I was pretty sure if I left it with them it would have just been refurbished and resold and I wasn't going to give them any more money.When the computer was returned my dad took it apart, cleaned the moisture out with a q-tip and alcohol, used a blow dryer to complete the job and put it back together.  20 - 30 minutes and no parts necessary.  It works like brand new again.My conclusion is that Intelisol, the company Samsung contracts for their customer support, is unethical in their business practices or they do not know what they are doing.  Because of this I would certainly recommend against buying the Samsung product and purchase another brand that does not use Intelisol.

This product demonstrates how the Google suite of products if fully capable of replacing the PC.  It is a joy to use.  On top of that, I am extremely satisfied with Amazon's quick shipping that landed the Chromebook on our doorstep on Christmas Eve.  This product had been back-ordered through December and getting in time for Christmas was a family treat.

1410,"Just got my Chromebook this afternoon. I've fiddled with it nonstop for about 5 hours and have come away quite pleased. First let's describe what this is: a cheap laptop to browse the web and send a few emails while using a lightweight Linux based, Google developed OS - Chrome OS. Having said that, I sent some emails, I browsed the web non-stop, watched a 1080p video, configured a couple VPNs, connected to 5Ghz 802.11n and did a speed test on my home network, and listened to Pandora nonstop, all while having it unplugged (after a full charge of course) to see how the battery held up. Here's what happened.Web Browsing - Great experience, web pages loaded fairly quickly and I was able to keep upwards of 7 tabs open in Chrome without many problems. I left Pandora running the entire time I was browsing. This would cause some weird issues where Pandora would stop playing, I would have to click on the Pandora tab and it would reload the whole tab, and then start playing again. I replicated this 3-4 times. I found that closing a couple tabs made Pandora behave a little better. Probably a symptom of having such a  resource light laptop, but that's to be expected - especially at this price.Speakers - The speakers themselves are pretty bad. You can turn them all the way up and just not really think they are turned all the way up. They fire directly into your lap, so the sound is absorbed quite easily by pants or blanket material that is in the way. Having said that, they would be more than adequate to watch a movie in bed or listening to music as long as you aren't looking for a hi fidelity experience.Battery life - I left it unplugged for about 2.5 hours, listened to music, watched about 5 minutes of a movie file, watched various YouTube clips, did some configurations of the OS itself, and did a couple speed tests, all while web browsing non-stop. Under this pretty intensive work load I was left with 64% battery life left. My calculations tell me this would give me a 6.5 hour battery life. That is exactly what Google and Samsung claim, and I can live with that. Very impressive, especially for being such a light and thin device.Wifi Speed - I connected to my home 802.11n access point, using the 5Ghz radio, and was able to attain 30+ Mbps download and 20+ Mbps upload speeds using speedtest.net. Pretty great, I don't think the wifi speed will ever be a bottleneck for me.VPN - I was able to configure multiple VPN connections after a few hiccups. I confirmed these connected were working by checking my IP address location using [...]. Configuration was relatively painless and Chrome OS seems to support OpenVPN, L2TP/IPSec + PSK, and L2TP/IPSec + User Certificate options.User Accounts - The Chromebook supports multiple user accounts, which is cool. However there seems to be some usability issues. I signed in and set up the VPN connections, sync'd my Chrome extensions and messed around. Then  I let my wife log in with her account and things got weird. It prompted something about using a different password for her than last time (this was her first time ever logging onto a Chrome OS device). Then I logged her out (it doesn't support account switching) and logged back in under my account, it gave me the same error about using a different password than last time I logged in (it was the same password I used the first time) and then I noticed my VPN connections were gone, and I opened Chrome to find it was syncing my extensions again like I had never done it before. However my background and user icons were what I had set them to earlier. Also, my wife and I both use two factor authentication (TFA) with our Google accounts. Logging in to the Chromebox will prompt you for a TFA code after entering your username and password, however there is no ""trust this computer"" option as there is with Windows machines and even certain Google applications within Android. This is a convenience vs. security issue, however it should be up to the user whether or not they trust the computer they are signing in to.Keyboard and Trackpad - Both work just fine, the keyboard is a little small but it is very usable and the trackpad is great. You get used to two finger scrolling in a minute even dragging is easy to do.Screen - The screen is small, and the resolution isn't great. The viewing angles are also not great. Definitely a big concession to the price.Charger -  The charger has an absurdly small connector. I have personally ruined two laptops because the power connector became loose when connecting. I will definitely have to be careful with this.Overall I am very happy with my purchase. I know that Chrome OS is a work in progress and I look forward to seeing the improvements over time, just like Android, and Chrome, and all the other wonderful things that Google does. I hope Netflix support is added soon (they promise that it is) and that the large influx of Chrome OS users from this devices give Google reason to work even harder on fixing the bugs and adding features. If you know what you are buying, both in the software and hardware, and realize you are paying $250 for it, you will be pleased too.P.S. I would pay another $50-$100 to add a back-lit keyboard and a better screen. Hopefully there will be some more tiers of Chromebooks coming out soon.

1411,"First and foremost, this is not meant to be a traditional laptop. When my laptop died, I searched on Amazon and when I saw the price of this I did a tiny bit of research (if you could call it research) and just went with it. If all you need is a connection to the internet and a keyboard, this will be great for you. The pros of this are that its very portable (thin and light), and its inexpensive. The cons are that its a little slow if you try to multitask too much, and it cant run most programs. Its pretty much just a browser, but for the price I can't really argue. I have an iPhone and iPad and since the chromebook can't run iTunes, I decided to get a MacBook.My only tip is that if you plan on buying this mostly for consumption, like surfing and watching youtube, then when you don't have internet its pretty much useless because theres not much memory to store videos. You can buy an SDHC/SDXC card but that does not come with the laptop. If you plan on using it to produce the few things that it can produce, like type an essay, then this can be useful without an internet connection. Hope this helps!

1424,"I was looking for a small, portable, efficient, and reliable computer to bring to class, the library, ect.  I was very skeptical about purchasing a computer that barely had a hard drive...how am I supposed to take notes?I've had this computer for a couple of months, and I am extremely happy with it.  Using Google Drive to take notes works PERFECTLY, plus everything is automatically backed up.  It's also very easy to download documents to and from your main computer. It's also easy on my nerves that if for some reason the computer breaks or is stolen I won't lose any data.  Battery easily lasts all day (though I always have to charge it at night). It's easy to use, small and light, and gets the job done for students!Bottom line: You really should have a ""main"" computer which you leave at home if you want to watch movies, download music, play games, etc. However, i'd HIGHLY recommend getting a chromebook in addition to that for all of the above reasons. I haven't had any issues with performance.  Also I got the 3g version but I haven't had to even use it yet (nowadays you can get wireless anywhere).  It's a GREAT purchase for students....highly recommend!  Don't get it if you are expecting a ""do everything computer"", but if you want to browse the internet and take notes/write, this is definitely the computer for you (oh, and the speakers arent bad either if you are a pandora person!).

1426,"tl;dr: Nice with ChromeOS, but I recommend the 3G version if you use it not just at home; /very/ nice with Linux. Both opinions take the price into consideration.Arrived from Amazon Warehouse deals in mint condition.Boot time and general usability for web browsing is amazing, considered the price: you don't get a MacBook Air, but then you also don't have to pay the price of the latter. The keyboard is one of the best I've seen in laptops of this size, although you might miss the F11 and F12 button and the ""correct"" positioning of the function keys if you plan to not only use Chrome. Also, page up/down keys would have been nice, but you can get around without them. The display is okay; brightness is not too high, but it's matte, not glossy, so for serious applications I actually like it more than some of the displays usually ranked better. One real drawback is that the angle in which you can open the display is quite restricted; a little more would have been better. The touchpad is also nice, but be aware that it doesn't support real multitouch (like pinch-zooming and rotation). Overall, the build quality is amazingly good, it is rather light and feels pretty robust for a device that inexpensive.Battery life seems to match the advertisements; 6h are realistic. For international users (I know, I know, you're not supposed to export this; just in case you still are a naughty girl): the AC adapter comes with a Mickey Mouse plug (IEC C5/C6), so you can just buy an according power cable and use wherever you go.After a few hours, I did what I planned to do in the first place: get Linux on it. Installing Ubuntu (using crouton) worked like a charm within minutes, and makes this machine useful also on the road without internet connection. Switching between the two operating systems (in this setup, they run side-by-side, both using the ChromeOS kernel) is instantaneous. Camera, microphone and speakers work in Linux. (But there are stories that you can melt your speaker with some settings, so be careful or wait until these issues are reported as resolved; use your google-fu and don't trust anybody.) Playing movies worked smoothly with mplayer (faster than on ChromeOS, actually). This might be different if you don't use the ChromeOS kernel, though, because AFAIK there is no good open source support for the rendering hardware yet.You can get most important applications for a Linux system like this, but be prepared to put in more configuration effort than for a standard desktop system. In part because you have to configure the system nicely for the screen size and to use the function keys not too often (this gets annoying because you won't hit the correct ones blindly), but also because you lack the Windows or Apple key between Ctrl and Alt, which typically is important for the window managers. (You can, however, reconfigure the ""search"" key at Caps location to resemble a fn key, to get page up/down and home/end as second-level options of the arrow keys.) Besides, the entire setup is non-standard - Chromebooks don't boot as usual PCs, due to an additional indirection layer before the BIOS; the use-the-ChromeOS-kernel configuration is not what distributions usually intend to work on; and the SSD drive (which really is a 16GB eMMC) is not what you typically find these days on a random machine.I'm not sure how a more demanding desktop environment will perform; crouton's ""default"" I'm currently using is XFCE, which is pretty fast, but I usually use awesome, which is even less resource intensive. Besides, I don't need graphics that much; thus, 2D and 3D performance is no dealbreaker for me. But, as I said, movies work fine.One important thing to note: Skype is currently not available on ARM chips other than smartphones. This not only means ChromeOS, but also Linux. I repeat: no Skype currently, and it looks like Microsoft doesn't (yet) have mid-term plans to change this. I've tried with qemu, but haven't been successful so far. But then again, there is a growing number of people in the Linux community playing around with inexpensive ARM-based hardware like this Chromebook and also the RaspberryPi, so I expect that the ARM ecosystem will develop very fast in the next few months. Invest and wait, or invest and help!If you don't plan to upgrade to a ""full-grown"" operating system but use it anywhere else than your sofa, consider buying the 3G version instead. ChromeOS itself is no fun without internet connection.
            "
1427,"Boot up is way quicker than any version of windows. if you have done your research on Chromebooks, you know that your data is save to the ""Cloud"" (somewhere else).  for basic functions like word documents, spreadsheet creation and web surfing, this product works well.  if you have special software or games, you will need a regular pc.

1428,"I was very hesitant to buy a chromebook - kept thinking about buying a standard laptop running microsoft, but I started thinking: I don't like microsoft products, I work with linux distros anyways daily, and I hate having to re-buy microsoft office every friggin time I get a new system (office 360? no thank you!)So rather than buy an older system and install a copy of fedora on it and deal with some of the headaches that result from running on an older system, I went with the chromebook. I do not regret my decision in the least. Google docs runs in a similar way to what Microsoft office did at one point, and since google has come up with a way to match what microsoft has to offer at almost every turn (or has one in the works), this is the perfect product to choose.

However I am very happy to say that the Samsung Chromebook is in fact of very high quality.I'm a student, and lugging around that 15 inch laptop has been a pain in the butt. Additionally, my laptop had a malfunctioning screen, most likely because of me constantly moving it from place to place. I really wanted something smaller, something that I would bang around and not be worried about, something that would do my everyday computing tasks, and the Samsung Chromebook had met everyone of my needs.Additionally, the battery life is superb, and the robust set of plug ins (HDMI, USB 2, USB 3, SD, and Headphone Jack) really make it useful and versatile. This is not just a novelty item. This is a serious computer device that can do a lot of things and fill a lot of roles.After over a week with this product, I've realized I could've gotten away with not even purchasing Microsoft office; google docs, google slides, and google spreadsheets are excellent and competitive alternatives, not to mention they're free.I was not expecting such a good peice of equipment, but for $250, Samsung and google have delivered a stellar product and are sure to give Mac's and the PC a run for their money.

1431,"If you are a PC gamer, this laptop is definitely not for you. However, I've found that I can use the computer for most things that I need to do, despite frequently using Word programs, Spotify, and other downloadable programs in the past. Google Drive gets the job done for documents, presentations, and spreadsheets, and more and more programs are choosing the online route (Spotify recently launched it's online beta, for example), allowing Chromebook users to access previously inaccessible programs. On top of it all, every update that Google Chromebook comes up with for its OS goes straight to your computer, so I'm sure improvements are coming, as there are a few shortcomings with the device. A solid purchase for most standard laptop users, and very cheap.**It is also worth noting that I have been using the Chtromebook in China, a country that blocks many websites that I frequent. VPNs solve this problem for most computers, but past versions of the Chromebook did not adequately address the issue. I am new to VPNs, and with this Chromebook, it took me a while to figure it out - but, the Chromebook has been designed to allow for VPNs, and mine has been working flawlessly since I got it to start working. So, even up against the Great Firewall of China, an internet-based device like the Chromebook can thrive.

Actually, I thought Samsung was quite inferior to the other brands out there, but I will say that my opinion has changed completely. A month ago I was experiencing some problems with my desktop so I bought this Chromebook as a cheap solution...and I absolutely love it. It is very lightweight. I love that it doesn't have any fans, so there is no fear of it overheating. I've not had any trouble logging onto any websites. Believe me, I'll let Netflix play all night and I have not had any issues with the it cutting off at all. The volume is very very nice. The screen is average. The size is great for handling.The keys are soundless. Every now and then the Chromebook will shutdown on its own in order to update everything, but it's very rare and it saves absolutely everything. Unfortunately, my only real complaint about the Chromebook is that the cover must have been made out of very cheap material because I've only had it for a month and there are scratches all over the top. However, Samsung sells these really cool protective skins. I found some at Decalgirls.com for like 20 bucks and they work really really well. (AND NO, THEY AREN'T JUST FOR GIRLS< YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE THEM HOWEVER YOU LIKE). I would not advise an older, working individual to buy one simply because this is more fit for college students. It is no different from an Ipad, but you cannot treat it as an apple product. Samsung WILL NOT cooperate with Itunes, but you already know that. Of course, you need the internet for absolutely everything on it. As a college student, I need the internet daily anyways so that isn't an issue for me.  All in all, the Samsung Chromebook is cheap, yet has great features on it. If you're already thinking about it, my advice is to just go for it.

Having gotten it set up, though, it's a great, zippy laptop; startup is instantaneous; great battery life. An absolute steal for the price.

I have downloaded a few apps from googles play store, but not all the apps run on this computer.I use this computer for word processing a lot, and its great because you can use it offline or online. When you type offline, then log on it connects your drive (from computer) to your drive online. So saving is easy. It uses Google Chrome to browser.There really isn't anything on the desktop, but you can put icons there for shortcuts.Computer boots up fast, and its cheap.The Battery seems to last forever!

After all, how could you lose at $250?? for a notebook.  After the adjustment period (for instance, no delete key), I was sold.  It is fast, a wonderful size for toting around, with beautiful image.  For that kind of money, you can feel really happy to use it for email and internet and go to the desktop for any production work you might have.

Took a little time getting used to the trackpad but the keyboard has a nice feel and you can always use a small mouse via blue-tooth or usb plug-in.  Hope to see a better screen down the road but it may not be possible and still maintain the low price. Wonderful battery life (6+ hours so far).  Bring a touchscreen to this device with only a small bump in price and it'll be a huge success.

The only real difficulty is file management, especially if you do heavy document work.As value for money it must be 6 stars. I have the feeling that cloud computing will soon become the new norm.I have used this computer every day for two years with satisfaction - Alas the screen has developed a large number dead pixels in one corner resulting in significant black areas and radiating lines - I have to reduce my number of stars - but my new one will be a chrome book of some sort

Granted you need to know that you are dealing with something that is primarily used for internet browsing and has limited offline capability in Chrome OS not windows but if that is okay with you (it is for me) then this is great.

Well, I had to check it out.  Since I use many of the Google Services - Mail, docs, voice, etc, and I also have an unlimited dataplan on my 4G LTE phone which I can tether the device to, I decided to give it a try.  It works great for what I use it for.  It is not the speediest of machines but then again at $249 it is nearly a disposable computing device after 2 years of use, btw, I think I will get much more than 2 year.  Add in 12 passes for GoGo inflight internet coupons ($9 a piece) this thing was a bargain.  Simply turn it on when in flight and it verifies you are on a Chromebook and you are logged in with your Google account (email) and you are surfing at 30k feet.The battery does really seem to go the distance of 5hours and having no fan it is absolutely silent.  It doesn't get hot but just warm to the touch near the back of the notebook where I think the processor is located.  The keyboard is nice and very similar to the Macbook keyboards.  It's a bummer there isn't a backlight but at the price point it is understandable why there isn't one.One thing I am waiting for is a more mature upgrade/hack to run ubuntu ringtail.  Someone at Google already posted a version that is supposed to work.  It would make the device into a full blown laptop running the ARM Exynos Samsung processor.  It will be killer to have this as a really lightweight (literally) but powerful Linux laptop for $249.The only downside for this machine is that the surface scratches very easily.  Other than that, at $249, this thing has really exceeded my expectations.

1511,"This little computer is what I've wanted in a PC for years: fast, fanless, quiet, and compact.  It's all those things, and it's even better made than most Windows laptops that are twice the price.  Chrome OS might not be for everyone, but it has major advantages (simplicity, automatic upgrades, security) and looks nice, too.  I had initially been concerned that I would have trouble not being able to access Adobe or MS software, but the Chrome apps cover 90% of what I need to do, and for the other 10%, I can use Chrome Remote Desktop to connect to my PC and can run the software through the browser---it works amazingly well.The computer is almost perfect and for $250 ($330 for 3G) I am extremely satisfied.  Here are the pros and cons as I see them:PROS- Completely quiet: no fans- Ventless and therefore versatile: you can use the computer anywhere, even in bed, without worrying about the computer's ventilation/overheating- Fast: it boots up amazingly quickly, and I have a hard time seeing any performance difference between this and Chrome on my desktop PC.- Nice UI: clean and simple, with lots of very useful and quick keyboard shortcuts- Matte screen: no annoying reflections on the screen, and you can use it in bright rooms with no trouble- Great keyboard and Mac-like trackpad: these really feel like they belong to a much more expensive computer- Very good battery life: minimum of 6.5 hours, up to 8-9 with low screen brightness- The 3G connection is good, connects quickly and seamlessly when WiFi is not available; connection is surprisingly fast for 3GCONS- Can't run some software (but Chrome Remote Desktop can solve this problem if you have a PC or server running the software)- Palmrest is a little too short for my large hands, which forces me to type with more ""curl"" than I'm used to to avoid having my palm rest on the edge somewhat uncomfortably.  This could be an issue for ""flat"" typists, too.This is a superb value of a computer, and it's fun to be using an always-improving computer that's on what might be a new frontier of simpler computing in the cloud.

That's a new concept in personal computing...better performance tomorrow than today. As Google pours more resources in the cloud-based OS, my computer will directly benefit...transparently...over time.

The Chromebook is all internet based where everything is run by the browser. I can't remember the last time I even used a software program.Pros:- Lightweight with an Apple Macbook-like design- Crisp webcam- Fast start and shut down sequence- Online tasks are all integrated with the Google platform.- The spacing of the keys make it easy to type on a small keyboard.- Click and keypad gestures are just like a Macbook - makes for easy browsing.Cons:- Doesn't seem as sturdy at some more expensive products on the market.- The screen resolution isn't top-notch bright compared to competitors.- Battery life is about 5.5 hours for me (it's normal, but always room for improvements)- Speakers are excellent, but sometimes seems a little muffled (however it doesn't affect the quality of sound).I would recommend the Google Chromebook for people who usually get online to shop, surf, email and social networking. For people who are developers or who use software programs, this isn't the computer for you.I have used this product for checking and writing email, writing for my blog, shopping, surfing the websites, and updating social media. For updating websites and producing music, I obviously will use a desktop computer running Windows or Apple. I like the fact that you don't have to worry about installing security updates and having to restart the computer. Everything is done for you in the background without you even knowing about it. I'm not kidding about  quick start up, it literally is 5 seconds or less for me.This computer does not have a CD bay, so if you are looking to burn CD's, a different computer should be available. It has USB ports and micro card readers for additional storage space since the computer hard disk is not capable of holding large amounts of data. However, if you are a Google user, you can utilize the free online storage to save files and access them from anywhere.The biggest question I get from my friends is how do you install a word or spreadsheet program. Easy, Google products have them available online for free. You can save the documents as a .doc or .exe file when needed.Overall, if you want an every day computer to complete the tasks above, this is a great buy for the money! If you are an avid Google products user, you will get the hang of it with a snap of the finger. If you are not a Google or GMail user, then it may take a few minutes to understand all the apps and online tools provided to you.I am happy with my purchase, and this product has already replaced my laptop computer.

One email later, my 2nd Chromebook was already being shipped and I had a free UPS pickup for the 1st to be sent back!! 2 days later... Tadaaa! Plugged it in, turned it on and it worked wonderfully! I LOVE it! My Chrome home page and all of my Google stuff from my PC and everything loaded on them is automatically right there on my Chromebook too! I'm still getting used to operating everything through apps,and my only small complaint is that until there is a replacement for Java (Google & Mac will not allow downloads because of Java instability) I can't play games from Pogo.com on it, but,I'm hoping that very soon, that will be rectified.My husband has taken it on the road, found plenty of WiFi to connect with and been able to use it easily. Also love the built in camera, the standard sized keys and 'oversized' touchpad, and am VERY pleased with my decision to go with a solid state drive vs a hard drive.Yes I would buy this again! Great deal for the price!

1528,"The Chromebook is an excellent choice and great for taking on trips. At $249, it has unbeatable value. There are special features that make it very convenient such as automatic synchronization of bookmarks and documents on Google Drive. Books on Kindle and iTunes songs are a snap to synchronize. Google docs allows working with MS Office documents. However, it does not have the full features. The screen is glare free. It is lighter than an iPad, with a bigger screen. The Chromebook still lacks certain features like being able to install third party software from disks. The apps are limited. But at $249, you can't go wrong. I've read where there is a $199 Chromebook from Acer. If it duplicates the Samsung, that's an even better deal!

It took less than a minute to get online.With Google services like Drive, you can write papers and create slideshows, upload files, and even work documents collaboratively in real-time with other people all on the cloud. You can also upload and stream music, edit and store photos, video chat, etc.Though you won't be playing high-end games on this Chromebook, the Chrome Web Store does offer some casual games.The OS is extremely secure. Browse the web without fear of viruses or malware.Bottom line, this Chromebook is a great alternative to Windows and Apple computers for most people. And at an awesome price.

1537,"This is a nice Chromebook, I've owned it for almost a year and it's still working fine and boots up very quickly. A Chromebook really is more than enough for most people's everyday internet needs, and many people would be surprised with how easy it is to live without Windows or Mac products. I did end up buying a Windows laptop in the last couple weeks since I am a college student, and Windows is more appropriate for me. For someone looking for a second computer or a very lightweight computer, a Chromebook is a great option! If you're a college student, you will probably be better off buying a decent Windows/Mac laptop, just make sure that if you're buying a Windows laptop you buy a decent one, preferably one with at least an i3 processor, otherwise the laptop will most likely be pretty slow.

I am happy to report that IT IS BETTER than ANY computer with any version of Microsoft Windows I have ever had, including Windows 8, and now 8.1.  My Chromebook offers more freedom and is versatile.  My Chromebook is light weight and fits in my purse and allows me to access web sites without the limitations of mobile devices.  My Chromebook is my new best friend and without a doubt, cloud computing is the future.  My Google Drive, cloud printer, and my Android phone having a scanner application, I AM READY for anything the future brings.  Thank you Google!  P. S. I bought a second one because its so affordable.

1540,"no OS besides chrome - It is the only downside or in my opinion it is the best upside because of the lack of windope software and all the ram/hard drive space that a normal laptop uses.  Also for some, the lack of ethernet port & CD tray may be annoying if they were hoping for a true laptop.  It is a glorified tablet without a touch screen but I must say browsing the web on wifi is extremely fast.  Bluetooth and chrome apps are becoming my friends and I transferred all my music to Google Play.  Another couple bonuses is the long battery life - reminds me of my ipad 2 or even longer and who doesn't love the quick booting when you start it up.  At $249 free shipping it is a no-brainer.

It started up right out of the box. All I had to do was charge it for a little while, which didn't take long at all. It has a great battery life very fast start-up time. I also really like that it has built-in security and that I don't have to pay for that separately. The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is that there is a glitch whenever I want to print anything. I had to set up my printer for the chromebook on my laptop and it still has to go through it but that may just be me, or my printer!

1547,"I bought my Chromebook as a bit of a toy and wasn't expecting much from it.  Now I can honestly say that I use this machine more than my desktop.Build quality is great.  Battery life is 7 hours or more of usage between charges.  Keyboard feels excellent.  Multitouch pad is responsive.  The machine runs silently.ChromeOS is really the wildcard for this machine.  And going in you have to know if ChromeOS will be right for you.  If you just want a machine to do email, text documents, spreadsheets and the web, you cannot do better than Chrome.  It is fast and rock solid.  If you need to do something computationally heavy, Photoshop, CAD, etc, go buy yourself a Windows or Mac laptop.  Programming is in a bit of a gray area.  If you do most of your programming through SSH and not using a fancy IDE like Eclipse, this machine really works great.Bottom line: depends on what you want if you will be pleased.  Chrome is completely usable.  It could even be a primary OS, but can it replace windows machine completely?  That depends upon what you do.

1550,"Really poised on liking this product. I am familiar with the concept, I am an IT professional and for me it was just making sense. Unfortunately there were 2 major issues that made me return the product for a refund not replacement: the web cam never worked, out of the box, and the screen was pixelating during boot and had few dead pixels. Aside from this, there is still a major problem with the screen: it is almost impossible to see (low brightness) in any kind of light  - even in absolute darkness it looks washed out.Other than that the keyboard, touchpad and whole concept are great. You are up and running in like 5 minutes and everything synchronizes nicely with your Google account.Again, great concept, but I would have gladly payed $50 more for a workable screen.

1551,"The Chromebook is fast and nice to work on however, I found a big glitch with mine.  It doesn't recognize my older camera and I can't print from it.  This is because both my camera and printer are a bit older--I think I purchased the Canon 8 megabit camera about 5 or 6 years ago.  To access my pictures I have to take the SD card out and put it in the slot--using the USB plug does nothing. This is not convenient.The cloud printing doesn't work if,like me, your printer is 8-10 years old and isn't hooked into Wi-Fi. I am not about to buy a new one, so I have to use my PC laptop if I have things to print. This is also not convenient. If the printer ever breaks down, I'll get a cloud printer but I'm cheap and will wait.So, it is nice small etc. but it has its issues. If you have ""old"" stuff, like me,there can be problems. Further, it doesn't have right click so that can be a hassle if you've been using a PC.  I still can't get spell check to work.The good thing is you can go to the Chrome Forum and ask lots of questions and Google people will help. They are very helpful and patient and get back to your right away.

He loves to look at the news, and he orders lots of things online after I taught him how to shop! :) This machine is perfect for what he needs. It is very fast, though I think it would run faster if we had faster internet service.I now want one for myself. The only drawback to this machine is that there is no CD drive, and you can't have basic software like Microsoft office. You have to use Google Docs. I wouldn't recommend this for someone who does a lot of document processing. It's perfect for web surfing, social networking, and basic internet usage.

The start up process was exactly what the prior reviews have said: open the top, self activates and recognizes my home network within 10 seconds. It did an approx 5 minute download for updates, and I was good to go. Screen is great, keyboard layout great as well. I also like the lower case font keyboard, just a personal thing. Build quality appears above average for a unit the price as this one. No creaky screen or flexing as of yet, as I have come to hear in other reviews.The websites come up fast and flawless. As an enterprise PC user due to work purposes (corporate pc's with Dell laptops), it is somewhat refreshing to use the Google documents section. I understand there is 100gb for 2 years on Google drive as well as ""coupons"" for 12 free wi-fi events for flying. I have not seen that information in the packaging, so I am ""assuming"" at this point it is electronically recorded. I will investigate that and report back accordingly. Again, a happy customer so far. I will write back after a few days with additional impressions, but so far, this fills a void between a ""full size"" lap top, and a tablet (of which I have 2). And by the way, you can't beat the price. Stay tuned...Update 11/26:Activated the 100g Google Drive storage. The gogo airline wifi is activated when you log on whilst onboard the flight, the Chromebook so far is exceeding expectations.

Google docs - been a user of google docs for a long time and absolutely love it. Collaborative editing couldn't have gotten better.4. Keyboard is very very easy to use. The keys are well spaced.5. Trackpad is also very usable. Smooth scrolling is almost on par with the Mac family of computers.6. Screen - It's not a reflective screen like that of the macbook air/pro. I personally like this. The colors don't stand out so vividly, but for text based tasks this is a non issue.7. Weight - Extremely light and portable. I, at first did not believe the weight :).8. Battery life - 6.5 hours without videos. If i were to watch a movie, this would probably come down to 4-5 hours.For my use case - web/c++ development on the cloud, this is a really nice laptop.

1586,"The Chromebook fits a small niche of the market, and I'm in that niche.I've been increasingly frustrated with my iPad and its poor web surfing ability (mobile versions of pages, formatting pages wrong, zoom resetting randomly, and the lack of Flash and proper Java still an issue with the many sites I frequent) and I found that I don't need a tablet in my life -- all of my computing and game playing is done on my beasty desktop gaming PC.What I really needed in my life is a small, very light laptop for surfing the net on my couch or in bed, with a few misc extras. Netbooks are notoriously slow and bogged down due to their ""light but not light"" versions of Windows, which is overpowered compared to their hardware. The Chromebook boots quickly and returns from sleep mode and picks up my home WiFi in less than 4 seconds consistently; it runs Chrome the web browser at normal speed and I have yet to run into any issues surfing the net. It has perfectly filled my need here. I haven't touched my iPad in the several weeks it's been since I got the Chromebook.I also installed Ubuntu onto an SD card via chrUbuntu, so I can boot into a full Linux OS whenever I'd like. Ubuntu runs at a decent speed, with minor issues.The bonus 2 years of 100Gb of Google Drive space is generous and a good deal as well. =)

I called for help on this issue thinking it was something I did wrong or could change but was told that that was the way it was made. It was very frustrating.  Also the Gmail was hard to follow to forward on to my friends.  No  obvious link was visible  so I returned it to go back to my heavy laptop.  If Samsung could fix these it would be an excellent move.  All in all though it is a nice bang for the buck.

It is super light and easy to carry. Great to have a keyboard when you are surfing the net in case you want to watch a video on youtube or something. I take it to college and take notes on it. Easier than writing them down and I find I take more notes. I found I only need wi-fi as college has it and like all my other devices if I need anything else I will run through my phone. The screen is perfect for what I need it for and looks just fine. This was a refurb and is working great. Save a few bucks too.

1592,"I bought this product using amazon.com (US) and Comgateway in order to obtain it. Living in Brussels (Belgium), this particular chromebook is not officially available in the European mainland as far as I know. This is the first drawback, it costs me additional fees to get it here via an intermediary company.Before I start with the critics I want to state that I serieously recommend this product to every everyday user of the internet. It is way better and efficient than using a much more expensive tablet. I think that most of the positive critics are already widely known due to Googles campaign and other news media writing about this product. So I will predominantly focus on the not so great experiences I sometimes had with this product the first few weeks after I received it.Startup, screen, speakersOn the functioning of the Chromebook: It works great! Seriously fast startup time as well as opening files etc. (due to the 16gb SSD) the screen is very clear and the speakers work fine. Keep in mind that I say this with the price category in mind. it is not a full-HD screen and the speakers are small and of mediocre quality compared to any high-end stereo system. Still equal or better than most notebooks I used.Bodythe plastic body is again of low cost quality but suffices when treated when care you'd expect from a notebook user. the four pads on the bottom that are used for support are working well, when on a hard surface it does not slip. A serious drawback is the thickness of the rubber supporters. just a small grain of hard material can cause loads of scratches on the bottom side. Like most notebooks the battery gets quite warm when using the charger or watching a long video like a movie. The absence of a hard drive (no fan) helps not getting overheated though.keyboard and touchpadthe keyboard is GREAT. I really like that Google kept the standard size despite of having a relatively small screen. It works great. not flaws whatsoever. Instead of the Caps-lock key there is a search key. Example of added application value: having a lot of bookmarks, it is much more efficient to just hit the search button and type the first 2-3 letters of the webpage, enter, of you gothe touchpad is another story; it works very precise, the clicking and tapping as well. But when the chromebook is charging, half of the time the touchpad is not precise at all. up and down, left and right movements are far from precise and diagonal movement is just impossible. One will see a zig-zag snake movement.Functioning Chrome OSChrome OS is working smooth most of the time. It is told that although it is a very stripped down operating system it works perfectly for its main goal: Getting the user the best internet experience. In my opinion this works great most of the time but there were several instances, especially when streaming videos and using the full screen mode, that the screen just goes black and one had to use the escape button to get it back working again. other more serious problems occurred also when in the same situation as mentioned before but then the whole system would all of a sudden shut down, for no reason. the last system failure I have experienced also for several times was that it just got stuck when playing a video in full screen mode. In the manual there is no solution for such a situation mentioned but i just pressed the on/off button for several seconds and the system would restart like nothing went down. So the stability of the system is seriously debatable in my opinion. fingers crossed that the automatic updates will solve these problems...Last point I want to critisize, is that loads of programs are not compatible (yet) with Chrome OS. Applications like Skype and Silverlight do not work on Chrome OS. Maybe because the group of users is still relatively small or maybe for other reasons. I hope google or the simple increase of Chrome OS user would change the minds of the companies that do not have made there applications Chrome OS compatible.Looking back at the above mentioned criticism, I do not want to create an image of this chromebook to be not good. I like it very much and use it every day. I love the product I got for the money I spend. It is just that one has to keep in mind that it is 'just' $250,- and Chrome OS has just started its rise to power in the market!

1633,"A $250 laptop is not going to be awesome and outperform expensive laptops. I understand that what I bought is basically a tiny internet machine and I have no complaints about that. I was happy with something that I could travel with, use to mess around on the internet and that's about it. For me, though, it's been buggy, buggy, buggy from the start, and I can't imagine ever traveling with it because it's been so undependable.Pros: Size. Keyboard. It's a great IDEA.Only con I care about: For a machine that basically only does one thing - the internet - it does that very inconsistently.In the first few days I've had it, these things happened:- It set up easily. Yay. 3G all fine, everything fine, easy.- I shut down the computer, ate dinner, went to log back in and couldn't. I got a ""corrupt"" error when I tried to log in. I couldn't log in as me; I couldn't even log in as a guest (I got the same error) and thus I could not get into the computer, period. It was basically bricked because of an authentication issue or something similar (according to the help files I found about this error).- For hours I could not get in. I shut down several times. I restarted my router. Next I got an error that the OS was ""broken"" and the whole OS needed to be reinstalled, factory fresh, which would wipe all my setup.- I was told to do this on a flash drive - download the OS file on another computer and bring it over. I tried and then I couldn't, because my brand new flash drive could not work with a Chromebook. Chromebooks do not run ANY - I repeat, ANY - exe files. None. The flash drive needed to run one to set up the software.- Then before boxing it to return it since the OS can't be reinstalled I try it one more time, for optimism. Yay, everything is back! No OS warnings! I connect to my wireless. It sort of works, but the wireless drops every few seconds, off and back, off and back, never staying connected for more than about 15 seconds, then disconnecting, then connecting again, over and over and over no matter how many times I restart it (both the computer and the router).-My phone, my ipod touch, my Macbook, and two very old backup laptops all connect to this wireless network without this problem. It's just the chromebook that can't do it consistently. It's been suggested I change router settings. Since this laptop is meant to travel, how can I rely on it if I have to mess with routers just to make it work as adequately as normal devices do? Is it really that buggy and finicky that you have to bend other technology around it so it will work for its one purpose, using the internet? I can't mess with routers on a plane, I can't do that at Starbucks, I'm not going to do it at someone else's house. It makes me think the laptop is just unreliable and buggy with different routers, which makes it kind of useless for travel.- My 9-year-old dinosaur of a Dell laptop loads pages at about the same speed. I know because I tried them next to each other. Only the Dell didn't keep dropping the wireless.- The latest error is that I can't search in Google as the app is not currently working. Suddenly. Randomly. It wasn't a problem 10 minutes ago; nothing happened; now it is. It tells me to get an extension then goes blank. And again, for a machine that only features the internet, not being able to search is an issue.- I restart and restart and restart and it's fine for a few minutes and then something goes haywire.I think the dream of a great, non-buggy $250 laptop was probably too good to be true. I knew it would be limited but I thought it would do really well at the one thing. I know some people had a different experience but I've only had the one and that's all I can speak to. I'm still giving it some stars because maybe mine's a lemon, and the size and idea are good, and I like the keyboard. It's just not a computer I would ever count on.

We both can actually WORK from our Chromebooks, which wasn't so easy with the tablet or phone. Any we can take them anywhere with zero effort, which wasn't so easy with the laptop given how heavy and clunky it is, slow slow slow boot time, and low battery life (ok, ok, it's a 5 year old Dell but it's much happier now that it can live in its docking station--and so am I).

Performance is pretty decent, I can manage 8+ tabs with no difficulty at all and without it feeling sluggish. Loading of web pages is slower than my desktop pc, but only by a few seconds it seems.From a hardware standpoint, the device is amazing, especially at its price point. Of course, the limiting factor is what you can and cannot do working from its browser:WORKS:HuluFlash video and gamesMicrosoft web apps (Skydrive)NetflixRemote Desktop (goes along really well with your desktop pc)DOES NOT WORK:Citrix reciever (yes, there is a chrome app, but it does not work unless the IT at your business/institution have things set up specifically to work with chrome os, which probably isn't the case)Amazon prime videoSome native client games (eg Bastion)All in all, I highly recommend it.

1679,"Bought this for my daughter for her to do her high school homework.  She wanted something slim and light but still allowed her to access the web and do word processingand presentations.  This works for just that but you have to rethink the whole concept of home/office productivity software that you are normally use to with a regular laptop where you have MS Office on your hard drive and then save things to your computer.  With Chromebook, you create a gmail account and use software and hard drive storage on the internet in the Cloud.  Once you get this concept and don't get hung up on having MS Word and Powerpoint as installed programs on your computer, this can really work.  Downside is you have to be connected to the net to access and edit your documents. Excellent for most everything you would use a tablet for but with a real keyboard that's super light weight.

1686,"The Chromebook is a fine little piece of machinery.  Small and portable, lightning fast, and cute to look at.  It's perfect for ALMOST anything you normally do on the web, but a severe Shockwave Flash problem has altered my love for this mini computer.  One thing that is nearly impossible to do on the Chromebook is edit a video - if you have any suggestions please comment below. I have tried Pixorial (Shockwave crashes every time), WeVideo, and Stupeflix.  None of them have the capabilities of Windows Movie Maker OR iMovie.  Like... not even close (you have to pay to remove the watermark, can't add voiceovers/music, etc.).  Try watching a video on MTV.com - guarantee you Shockwave will crash a few minutes in.  Other than those issues, I love this little guy.  Access social networks, write emails, read blogs, watch YouTube videos... works fine for all those things.The size of this machine is awesome. Small enough to fit in an average sized purse.  It is very lightweight - great for students who have to carry a lot in their backpacks.  The keyboard and trackpad are almost as good as that of the MacBook Air and speakers work fine.  Not studio sound but it's adequate.  Webcam doesn't work for me, the sound is distorted and the picture looks worse than the Logitech webcam I bought for $10 in the seventh grade.  Long story short: buy it for the portability and the price, but don't expect this to be your only computer, unless the only thing you do is browse the web.

There have a been a few little hiccups as with any computer but nothing like I experienced with the PC and associated windows issues. I love the 8-9 second boot time and no anti virus BS!!! If you can live with ""in the cloud"" computing this is a winner by my standards. Of course I wouldn't mind an even better price than the $249 I paid. No regrets here!
            "
1706,"Having spent a couple days using my new Chromebook, I've developed some initial thoughts.  The points below are made in consideration of the $249 price:Hardware: Simply amazing.  While there are many laptops that approach or equal the Chromebook for sleekness and many offer superior materials, all of these options are 3-6x the Chromebook price.  The keyboard feels great, the trackpad is sizeable and responsive.  Even closing the laptop is a joy.  The hinge resistance drops off at about 10 degrees where precise detenting provides an almost magnetic pull to close the device fully shut.  Lastly silicone bumpers complete the closure with a reassuring ""thump"" rather than a plasticy ""slap"".  This effect combine with the extremely thin result make me smile a little every time.Keyboard: I do wish some keys such as tab switching and full screen were provided in place of the window switching and maximize keys.  Also, I'd enjoy ""home"" and ""end"" buttons.  Overall the plastic appears durable and is the right material for a cheap laptop that will be obsolete within 2 years (the lifetime suggested by google's 2 year cloud storage service)Screen: The display is good.  I know that high end laptops have much nicer displays but many offer the same quality as the Chromebook.  The real story is how high end laptops are incorporating $80 displays not that the Chomebook falls short of an Apple retina.Camera: The user facing camera (webcam) is only VGA but is decent under low light and angled just right.  I haven't tried the mics yet but there are 2 of them so I'm guessing it's fine.Speakers: can get very loud and sound good on hard surfacesPorts: the headphone jack is reassuringly tight.  I haven't tried the HDMI, SD, or USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports.Computation: ARM processing was the right choice for the device.  At times, I can't help but feel the device is slightly underpowered; opening a few heavy webpages can cause Rdio to stutter very briefly.  However, I've managed to adjust pretty quickly to this minor limitation by keeping fewer tabs open.  ARM really shines with regard to thermal performance.  Even as I write these words in a warm room with the Chromebook on my fleece pajama pants, the laptop is barely warmer than my skin.  The dead silent operation and lack of an exhaust breeze (or any moving internals at all) is extremely reassuring initially but quickly you stop thinking about such things entirely which is probably the point.Chrome OS: The OS currently has a few limitations and bugs.  Loading a dozen tabs can cause some to refresh and I've seen reports of some folks losing long posts during these refreshes.  I write my posts in google docs which auto saves every few seconds so this isn't much of an issues for me.  Some pages like Amazon instant videos and Netflix streaming (hulu works well) aren't yet compatible with Chrome OS (apparently both are being worked upon).  I switched to the dev channel which allowed Amazon prime streaming to work initially but it has since stopped working.  Most other things work very well.  WiFi connections work very well and quickly.  I have a tethering shortcut on my phone which allows me to launch tethering, pop open the chromebook and with a few seconds be loading pages.  The screen wakes up after opening the lid within 2 seconds (~10 seconds from full rebooting).  Heavy pages load within seconds and perhaps only 1-2 seconds slower than on very fast SSD driven desktops.  My guess is that Chrome OS on ARM isn't yet fully optimized and that every 6 weeks (google's update cycle) the Chromebook will get slightly faster.Apps: I haven't played with these too much but I've found that Citrix doesn't work for either my wife or my work logins.  I use Keepass as my password manager and this isn't supported in the Chrome App store (I switched to LassPass).  Chrome Remote Desktop is very easy to set up (perhaps I can help mom with tech support now!) but I haven't turned on my desktop much since I got this toy...  Other random things like FitBit syncing via ANT likely won't work anytime soon.  Over the weekend I'll be setting up cloud printing and hopefully getting access to my network accessible storage thru the Synology app.  My hope is that as Chrome OS gains popularity, more developers will make more and better apps.Extras: 100 GB of cloud storage is very generous and I doubt I'll be able to fill it anytime soon.  The 12 GoGo in-flight passes will be very enjoyable during future flights and will be just about right for 2 years.  While I wouldn't have purchased $250 worth of these extras - it feels like a great deal to make use of them.As you can probably tell, I'm pretty happy with the Chromebook.  Although the device clearly isn't a ""full computer"", the cheap price allows me to put more money into my desktop machine to make it an even better media machine.  More importantly however, the limitations of the Chrome OS experience (closing extra tabs, a lack of system notifications, desktop files, etc) combined with the refreshing lack of heat or noise, allow for a distraction free experience.  The closest technology analogy is probably reading on a kindle.  I'm happy that Google hasn't felt compelled to incorporate Android into Chrome OS.  In time this may work but for now I'm happy to be in ""work"" mode on my Chromebook.  When it's time to play, I'll pick up my Nexus 7 or plot down at the desktop.  Less is more; Chrome OS is my 5th screen.

1711,"An inexpensive, yet well made, laptop that works for 90% of what I do on a computer these days. I can't see the point of waiting  for my Windows laptop to spin up, wake up and tease me for a few minutes, just to check email. If you realize that the bloated Windows operating system is a business system that Microsoft is always trying to shove into smaller devices, it will forever be a losing proposition. Mac OS suffers the same signs of old age.The fact that Chromebooks are basically running an OS that is still young and small and built on what has always been considered a superior OS (Linux and Unix), means that they are lean and light.The hardware in this Chromebook is also minimal, with no hard drive, no removable battery and limited ports. But this tends to keep the user focused on what they're using this device for. And for surfing and running web apps, this thing rocks.If you want to hack around the registry, overclock your CMOS or clean your dirty cache buffers (or whatever you kids do), build your own Windows PC and rock on.This is not that.

1729,"First let me say that this is a great little computer, especially if you are familiar with Google's products (gmail, chrome, drive, etc).  PLEASE do your research and know what the computer is capable of doing and not doing.  It's not a complete replacement for a windows/mac PC.My only beef with this upon unboxing and start-up was I kept getting very slow web page load times and even kept getting kicked off my home wifi network (that previously had worked without problems on a PC).  As you can imagine this was very frustrating at first, obviously smooth internet connectivity is crucial to get the most out of a Chromebook.Did some research and found this was not an uncommon problem with this model Chromebook (Samsung 550).  Do a google search for ""chomebook wifi connectivity problems"" or similar and you'll see what I'm talking about.In short, to fix this I had to tweak 2 of my home WiFi routers settings.  This forced me to educate myself on some WiFi ""lingo"".FULL DISCLOSURE:  I am not a tech geek, these steps below are just to point you in the right direction if you are having similar issues, not a comprehensive step by step!  Your mileage may vary!1.  To remedy slow page load times, I had to change my encryption settings on my wifi router from WEP (a setting NO ONE should be using, I learned) to WPA2-PSK.  This is a much more secure setting anyway and seems to work with chromebooks that are having very slow page load times running off home wifi (not 3G).2.  To remedy the issue of occasionally (often) losing my wifi connection, I had to change my wifi router's network mode (ie:  b/g/n) to just broadcasting on the g network only.  Apparently if you live in an area where other wifi networks are broadcasting on mixed modes, the Samsung 550s get ""confused"" and will bump you off.  I have not had any problems connecting to public wifi networks with this machine!Once I made these changes I am rocking just fine on this very low cost, super fast startup, no noisy fan having, seemingly well built machine!

1739,"I've had my Chromebook for less than a week.  It was simple to turn it on and start browsing right out of the box.  It's a sleek device and I like it, but it is buggy.  To see how buggy, just go to the Google Chromebook message boards and read about all the reported problems.  As for mine, the problem is sleep mode.  If I close the lid or let the unit remain idle long enough to trigger sleep mode, it goes into a coma.  The screen goes dark and the power light remains on as though it is sleeping, but nothing I do will revive it.  The only I can do is hold down the power button until the light goes off and then turn it back on.  Of course, I then get a message telling me there was an improper shut down, so to return to where I was, I must tell it to do a restore.  Of course, this is a great annoyance.I see from the message boards that many other people are experiencing this problem, especially for units made in January of 2013.  I reported the problem to Google, but they offered no solutions.  I reported the problem to Samsung and they instructed me to do a factory reset.  I did that, but the problem persists.Samsung support then told me to ship in for repair, but I'm expected to pay for the shipping and insurance, even though the unit was malfunctioning on day one.  Thankfully, Amazon pays for shipping for the return of malfunctioning devices, so I'm returning it to Amazon and asking for another unit.

1746,"After less than one month, it no longer works.  I called Samsung support, and they have arranged for me to send it back for repair.  Not a good experience so far.Update:My Chrombook stopped working after just two weeks.  I called Samsung support.  They asked me to try a reset, but the Chromebook was still dead.  So, they gave me a repair ticket number and a UPS shipping label.  I was told to include the power supply when shipping the unit in for repair.  I was glad that I kept the original packaging, which included the oblong internal box for the power supply.  The power supply is a bit large, since it is a brick design, and the internal oblong box ensures that it fits properly in the carton for shipping.The response I got via email was that the warranty was voided because I used the wrong power supply.  Included in the email was a photo of a power supply I had never seen before.  It was not a brick-type supply at all, but instead one of those smaller power supplies used with the old style cell phones.  I called to dispute this.  The person I talked to was a Samsung employee.  She put me on hold while she communicated by dispute with Intellisol. She then emailed me screenshots from a video that Intellisol had made when the technician opened the carton I had shipped.  These two screen shots clearly showed the incorrect power supply.  The only problem is that I did not ship them this incorrect power supply.  I shipped the power supply I received with the system.  So, I don't know whose box they were opening when they took the video, and how that video got associated with my unit.  At that point, I had nothing to say, since it was my word against Intellisol's video screen shots.  I asked how much it would cost to repair the unit, and was told $200.  I did not want to invest any more money in this Chromebook, so I asked them to sent it back to me un-repaired.  When I received it, it was operational!  However, they included the bad power supply, which I had never seen before in my life.  Now, I have a functional Chromebook but without  the correct power supply.  I just ordered one from Amazon.This was one bizarre experience.

1752,"This is my 2nd Chromebook.  I'm still using the old Chromebook (Samsung S5) at my house and I leave the new S3 ARM Chromebook at my girlfriend's house.  Since Chrome is cloud based and syncs so well I go between the two Chromebooks seamlessly.  The Chromebook S3 is faster than my old S5, and the built in speakers are much improved over the weak ones on the S5.While I'm not using the new S3 ARM Chromebook her 8 year old uses it (with supervision) for homework and games.  We set him up a Google account, and he knows how to sign me out and sign himself in. He operates the touch pad better than I can.  He uses the maximize button (shift-maximize) to go in and out of full screen for games.  He plugs it into the charger when he's done. It's kid proof.  No accidental erase of my data since Chrome keeps the two accounts totally separate. My girlfriend and I watch the Google Chromebook commercials that say Chromebook is ""The computer for the whole Family"" and we totally agree. A Chromebook is not for everyone, but it's good for a lot people young and old.I've had 20 gig of Google Storage (Drive) for over 2 years.  First time I opened Google Drive on the S3 it prompted me and took me through adding the 100gig (free for 2 years).  Drive and the Doc office applications are all I use now.  I've not used Word or Excel since I got the 1st Chromebook (I have Office 2007 on Windows).  I print from the Chromebook using Google Cloud print.I use Chrome for my browser of choice on Window which allows me to use Chrome Remote Desktop (by Google) to access and control my Windows PC from my Chromebook (S3 or S5) when needed. That is really handy.  I use the Chromebook's SSH terminal (CTRL-ALT-T) to access Linux systems instead using Putty (on windows).I can't do everything on a Chromebook and still need Windows a tiny bit. But the S5 Chromebook allowed me to avoid buying a new Windows laptop last year. Now that I have the S3 Chromebook and Google Remote Desktop I have no plan to EVER buy another Windows PC.

1779,"I purchased my Chromebook about 3 weeks ago and have been using it almost non-stop. It is a great secondary machine if you have a larger laptop or desktop computer that is not portable. If you need something to browse the web with while sitting on the couch, this is perfect and comes at a good price. I would recommend this product for what it is, NOT what it isn't.This machine is incredibly quick. The keyboard is great (i'm typing this review on it now) and using Google Drive has become incredibly convenient. The Chrome OS is very easy to use. There are not a whole lot of built in distractions on this machine, which is a plus for college students (which is what I am) who need a convenient machine to do homework on. The battery is also outstanding. On a relatively high brightness level, the battery lasted me a good 5-7 hours during non-stop use.The screen on this is not outstanding, but it gets the job done. The track pad could be much better, but once you get used to it it's not so bad. I would definitely recommend being INCREDIBLY careful with this machine. The finish on the Chromebook feels nice and it is incredibly lightweight, but because of it's cheap price, it seems like some of the materials used on this are also very cheap. This is definitely meant to be taken around frequently, but you still want to be careful when carrying it around. Overall this machine doesn't feel very durable (that includes the charger/AC adapter).I had read online before purchasing this that it had problems connecting with wi-fi at times. So far, there have been 2 or 3 separate occasions where the wi-fi suddenly dropped. This was fixed by a simple reboot, but hopefully it doesn't happen too many more times. Also, if you know you are not going to be using your Chromebook for an extended period of time, be sure you shut it down completely, not just close the lid and let it sleep. This will drain the battery significantly opposed to actually shutting down the Chromebook. Another con of this machine is the battery meter. The percentage is accurate, but the ""time left"" meter is not always very accurate and changes frequently. However, once you begin using this machine more often you get used to that.Again, this is a great machine for what it is, not what it isn't. It is not at all a replacement for a power user who is used to a Windows or Apple OS. But if you want something to take around with you to surf the web on, I would recommend it for that, just remember to be careful with it.

Makes a great guest computer since each user logs on using their gmail . I don't have to worry about others users looking at my data or changing my settings. No anti virus needed, no maintenance,SSD boots up super fast. Thinking of buying one for my elderly mother since it's so simple to use. I would recommend Samsung products and Google/chromebooks  to anyone needing a simple web browsing experience.

1799,"Just managed to get one and used it outside the US, the machine lives upto the expectation with good battery life (avg 5 hours) and its light weight.  Though I did find 3G setup to be a bit tricky and after I could get it up and running, switching from hybernation to active mode takes quite a bit of a time...final verdict--good product for daily usage!

1812,"My wife and I purchased this Chromebook initially as a secondary device, basically to use as a back-up for our much-used PC.  We instantly fell in love with its low maintenance, simplicity, and boot-up speed.  We quickly realized that it allowed us to do anything we needed to do on our regular laptop with a much more pleasant experience.  After becoming a Chromebook fan, I have convinced about 15 of my family members, friends, and co-workers to purchase one, and they all have the same experience as I.  As you do research on whether or not if this is the right device for you, ask yourself the following question:  What are the top 5 things I do on my laptop?  If they are related to the internet, (email/social networking/paying bills/purchasing items/web-browsing) then a Chromebook would be an excellent option.  As far as word processing/presentations/spreadsheets, the Google ecosystem has been a delight to use.  I have no desire to use MS office again now that I use Google apps.  Doubters will say that I don't believe in cloud computing, but when you ask them simple questions like ""do you bank online/do you have a web-based email/purchase items online?"", they then realize that many of their computing habits are already in the ""cloud"".It is so nice to customize the Chromebook the way that you want to use your computer, no additional software or ""stuff"" on your computer that you will never use.  Other pluses are automatic updates, no concerns about viruses, no fan/heat and extremely light to carry around.  Each day, I find out about other apps to use on the Chromebook, and it is exciting to have a device that simplifies your computing experience. It has become our primary computer and our conventional laptop has become a ""niche"" computer in the household (actually, I have only used our conventional laptop twice since purchasing this Chromebook over 8 months ago!).  If you have any doubts about this device, pay close attention to the reviews from the people who ACTUALLY own one, not the critics who don't really (nor care to) grasp the concept of the Chromebook.  The only negative I have experienced is the tip of the charger is very fragile and I had to replace it (under warranty)after 7 months of use.  The more this technology secret gets out to the masses, it will become a very popular device.

You will need to save your files to an external memory stick or use Google cloud. I do everything on mine, including print. Where can you get a laptop that does all this for 250 bucks?

1820,"I am generally a high-end user requiring a lot of computing power for large spreadsheets and SPSS. My machine prior to this was a XPS 16 with 2nd gen I7, 8 gig ram, and a 256 SSD. It was and is a great machine. Also, I have a 15 inch MacBook Pro. I have found both of the machines to be fantastic. However, when travelling or just for everyday non-desk use they can be a bit large and cumbersome.My research narrowed down my purchase of a portable option for travel to the ASUS Zenbook or the Lenovo Yoga.... both of which appear to be great machines. But then, I stumbled upon an article about the new Google Chromebook. The hook of the free go-go inflight passes, the 100 gigs of storage on GDrive, and the 100 meg month of 3g from Verizon caused me to reconsider my purchase decision. After some research, I decided to try the Chromebook.To echo many of the previous reviews, the build quality is very surprising for the price. In a nutshell, the Chromebook looks and feels very much like the 11 inch MacBook Air. Interestingly, while the chassis is plastic, it has a solid feel and there is NO flex in the keyboard. Typing on the Chromebook is a pleasure.I recognize that the little Chromebook hardware is much more of a mobile machine and less of a full featured computer than a Windows 8 or Mac OS machine. But with the variety of apps available for productivity, Chromebook gets the job done. The value of Chromebook cannot be beat. In addition, with the Chrome Remote desktop, I am able to utilize the higher-end computing power of my other machines when needed.For the price, I would recommend this machine to everyone.

My only complaint is that there is trouble with connectivity.  I've tried in different locations &, where my heftier laptop works just fine, the chromebook  spins 'thinking' about uploading a page.  A friend got a chrombook at the same time & has never experienced this problem, though.

1824,"I bought this with high hopes and the interface and form factors were quite good. Problem was that immediately out of the box I had a problem where the laptop, once closed in ""sleep"" mode, would not wake up once the lid was opened. The power light was on but no amount of keyboard activation or button pushing wakes it up. I had to do a hard shutdown which resulted in an error in Chrome saying it had shut down unexpectedly. While searching the web for a solution (many others had this problem) the machine began to shut down and restart spontaneously every 5-10 minutes.Long story short, I reset to factory setting twice, made sure I'd updated the OS, and when both problems persisted... I sent it back.Too bad. I really wanted to love it. But, these problems combined with a hilariously unhelpful Samsung.com support site made me realize I'm too busy to deal with this.

1826,"Thought about the bluetooth keyboard for use with my Galaxy and iPad tablets. But I realized that would not really support the way I wanted to write - on the go and not necessarily with a table. Since I don't own a laptop, this turns out to do everything I need. Most of the software I use for work is web-based anyway, so it's good for that. This thing has amazing battery life and is incredibly portable. It's my favorite piece of tech I own right now. I think I can do 95% of what I need armed with this Chromebook and my S3 phone. If you have a nice, portable laptop dedicated to home use, I can imagine that the Chromebook would be less appealing than a tablet. Tablets are nicer for bed use and reading in my opinion. The Chromebook really acts as my home laptop and I doubt I would have considered it if I had one. But it's a perfect solution if you don't.

It's either a browser crash--they close down, then come back up with option to ""restore,"" or the machine freezes completely, requiring a reboot with the on/off switch.Not exactly the dream machine I was hoping for.

I called Samsung and other than a power wash which they did the first time I called, there were not other options except to return it or send it to their repairs shop in Texas. I would suggest ordering a wireless mouse for using it. The man at Samsung said this should work and it has a UBS port for such.  If this doesn't work, I plan on returning the item.  Otherwise it is kind of easy to use.  No manual comes with it and you have to download it to see how it works.

It integrates great with gmail and the other google applications. The lack of a delete key is the one complaint I have, but that is minor after you use it a while.

I could access homework assignments, web searches, and Discussion Boards for classes and reply on the discussion board's.  This thing loads up so fast it will make your head spin!  For the person that is not very savvy with computers, it is relatively easy to navigate.  I did have issues with downloading some google aps, kept getting the ""your device is not found"" error.

I am still skeptical and afraid the symptoms may re-appear... but for now I am happy.Having played with the system for a while now, I have to say it's a great buy for $249.... it feels as light as an Apple Airbook, the keyboard feels great and it's dead-simple to use and seems fast enough for basic use. For what my daughter needs; web-browsing, google-docs, face-book, youtube and gmail, this machine is perfect. She doesn't need VPN-access, no video-editing or need to run any other native applications.I can't use the machine for my work; I realized I still have an array of native applications that I need for work or that I'd prefer to use instead of a browser based app (I don't like the gmail web-client).Because of the touchpad problems, not giving it a 5 star and if the problems reappear, I may even give it a lower rating...

1887,"I work in technology everyday. I have been researching inexpensive options for schools and have been following the Chromebooks since its conception. I am very pleased with what arrived. I thought that it would feel and look cheap, it doesn't! It is very well made, It actually looks like a MacBook air had a baby. The  keyboard is fantastic, the screen is great, the simplicity is amazing. I have an iPad, I have a MacBook aire and now my Chromebook! As a Technology Facilitator, I would highly recommend this for students. I absolutely love my Chromebook. It has 16 GB storage on the machine, 100 GB in the clouds, 2 USB ports, HDMI port, SD Card and Micro SD card slot, it  has everything you need. I live my life in the clouds, so it is perfect for me.Purchase it, you will be pleasantly surprised. The teachers that I work with see my Chromebook and are now purchasing their own. What is really nice, is the quality surpasses the price, which never happens. Kudos to you, Google!!!

I have had hinge problems with lap tops before and won't tolerate that again. I did the chat thing with Samsung and they asked for pictures which I sent and half an hour later ""Phillip"" told me he ""checked that the hinge is slightly displaced"". He then advised me to file a service request but first I had to register my Chromebook with Samsung. Now I'm having trouble filing a service request. The serial number field (required) won't accept keyboard input. This S$$it Plsses me off!Overall build quality though is fine from my point of view.. The keyboard is OK, spacing between the keys is even a little too far. The track pad I haven't quite gotten used to yet but I think it'll be OK. The flex, cheapness, plasticy comments I heard about I don't agree with, but Im not keen on twisting or flexing a computer.Otherwise, I think this little job here is fantastic. The google side of it seems to work well. I am a long time Chrome user and my chromebook desktop is now identical to the one on my laptop. All I had to do was log in to my gmail account and presto. The 100g google drive offer is currently unavailable for some reason but I'll get to that later.I haven't figured out where the delete key is yet.The SD card does stick out a bit but no big deal.I've been working on it on battery power for 45 minutes or so after a full charge and I have 91% left.The business end of the charger is a bit of a throwback, why couldn't they have used micro USB?So far, for the first couple hours, that's it

The keyboard is great - just the right amount of stiffness so I don't make keyboard mistakes. I can have multiple applications open at the same time, toggling between them easily.

1943,"I purchased the Chromebook and in the beginning was pretty satisfied with it. I read other peoples reviews and pretty much knew what I was getting. At first I felt that I got the bang for the buck, but then I started using it to watch video streams off the internet. I thought watching video would be a strength of the Chromebook since it is designed primarily for internet use so this is one of the reasons I purchased this device. I have found that this model does not seem to work well with streaming video from the internet. It is jerky, freezes to the point that I have to hold the on/off switch down until it reboots. Some times it reboots on its own. For example I went to the Crackle web site and tried to watch a TV show or movie. Forget it unless you have incredible patience and don't mind restarting your computer over and over. About 4 times in a half hour show. I have tried other web sites just to make sure it was not something to do with the Crackle web site. I also watched the same shows on my laptop with no problems.Pros - There are a lot of things I do like about the Chromebook; Very light, small and good for normal internet browsing. Good for linking to Google drive, email, calendar etc. Sound quality is decent. Battery last about as advertised. I do like the feel of the keyboard although it does not have a delete key only a backspace key.Cons - Doesn't seem to do well when watching video.Would it work in a school setting, which is what I bought the Chromebook for? I would think so, except for watching video.Hope this helps

I like it a lot.  I like the simplicity of it.  Have been follwing the chromebooks since the first model was released a few years ago.This samsung model has an ARM processor. There is one minor *gotcha* to the ARM processor. If you are thinking to install crouton + Ubuntu on your Chromebook, be aware that the Ubuntu that you will end up with is not the same as most Ubuntu installs.  Many ubuntu apps are missing, the most notable is there is no Ubuntu app store. So I had no idea how to install any apps.  I dropped to terminal mode and tried to use FTP and found it hadn't been installed.So Ubuntu on the Samsung arm chip chromebook wasn't useful to me and I did a Powerwash and put it back to normal Chromebook mode.Also something i have noticed - after you boot the Chromebook, you have 4 GB freespace on the internall SSD drive.  Not a real problem, because Chromebook users save everything to Google Drive. They give you 100 gb space on Google drive.The keyboard is great.

When looking at reviews, you have to keep in mind that the Chrome Os is just a browser and therefore you will not be able to use things that requires a driver/software (i.e scanner) and that it not suppose to be a primary computer/laptop.  But the Samsung 3G, WiFi chromebook works perfect as a portable internet portal.  The 3G is via Verizon and I purchase 1  GB for $20 per month because I use up the free monthly 100 MB.  But I never come close to using the 1 GB.  I also do not have to worry about antivirus and maintenance.  And since I do not store any sensitive info on the drive (I use the google drive), I do not have to worry about my client's info if the chromebook is lost or stolen.

1989,"I like using a tablet but still prefer to be able to use a keyboard. The largest benefit of a tablet is the fact that it is instantly on. The down side of a laptop is the time that it takes to boot. The Chromebook gives you nearly instant boot with the laptop keyboard.It won't do everything that a regular laptop will and it's not supposed to. It can be used as a couch surfer and still has a large enough keyboard to type papers. It's a great combination of what I was looking for. The price helps at $249 also.

He was unable to recommend an EDID capable projector.So if you work in a business or educational setting where you need to connect with a projector, wait until they get this fixed.Otherwise the samsung chromebook is well designed, easy to use and the price is right.

1998,"As I am typing this review with this product I can say that I absolutely love it! It is absolutely perfect for my needs. I'm not a ""tech geek"" or anything but I definitely appreciate being able to have a laptop which is extremely lightweight and so easy to bring with me just about everywhere. As a college student, this compact device is better than having a tablet as it is compatible with certain programs which the tablet I have is not. It is just as convenient, but more useful to me.I love how simple and quick everything is. Start up is within seconds, no loading screens, no nonsense. Log in and go. Also, shutting down is only seconds as well. My previous laptop had issues with shutdown and I couldn't close the screen until it was completely shut down or else it would interrupt the process. That usually took a few minutes. With the Chromebook, it's click, shut, and go. And shutting down rather than just closing saves battery life, even though that really is not an issue. While being used, it's currently calculating I have 90% battery left which adds up to 7 hours and 12 minutes. This is just great!With the exception of getting used to the placement of the keys on the keyboard (slightly different from a standard keyboard) I really enjoy how quiet typing is. I can sit and work on emails or papers in the library or at night without disturbing anyone because the keys aren't making a loud ticking noise as I am typing.Another feature, which was a huge selling point as I have had issues in the past, is the lack of fan and moving parts. It is very frustrating to have a laptop which can't be placed in your lap because it gets too hot. This laptop is always cool, which the exception of one spot which is barely lukewarm.Getting use to the smaller screen and type was an adjustment at first, but there is a setting feature which allows you to enlarge the type on a page without having to zoom into the screen which I like.Essentially, the Chromebook is great! It takes a little bit of getting used to but the adjustment only takes a short time. I'm sure there are some other things I haven't discovered and I haven't had a chance to get a good look through all of the apps available. The only small complaint that I have is the inability to stream on Netflix. I guess it's not compatible with the OS yet but they're working on it. But it's only a small complaint because I can use my tablet to watch Netflix and in that case I'm able to work on the laptop while watching movies and shows considering both of them are small and don't take up too much space.Overall, I am very happy with my new ""toy."" I've been bringing it with me everywhere I go!**UPDATE**Should have done this sooner. Unfortunately I had to drop my rating on this product only because within a few months I was no longer able to use it. Due to one fall from a counter top to a carpeted floor, my power adapter apparently suffered some unseen damage. (It landed flat on the bottom as it slid off the counter.) This caused the area around the adapter port to somehow overheat and melt. The damage was not immediately obvious to me and the next time I went to unplug my computer, the tiny metal piece snapped off inside the port itself. Because this was caused by a drop and I sadly had not purchased the extra warranty which covers drops, there was nothing I could do. I've considered purchasing another Chromebook, but with the adapter being so fragile, along with the strange sort of malfunction, I'm not sure I want to take that risk. It was a great little computer, while it lasted.

The exceptionally small size and the track pad in particular take some getting used to.My main disappointment in this machine is the fact that I cannot do any Facebook video chatting - it seems like Google has disabled this function in order to coerce you into using Google Hangout. It seems a bit underhanded, but oh well.I hope it holds up and continues to work as quickly as it does straight out of the box.Bottom line: It won't replace the PC or the Mac, but its worth the leap of faith for those seeking an inexpensive alternative for light computing.

On this computer, I have the batteries to complete a full day of coding, word processing, and data management without worrying about bringing a power cord.I would highly recommend this computer for anyone who has noticed that the only programs they open on their computer are: a web browser, a word processing program, a spreadsheet program, or other parts of the Office suite.

2051,"I will start this review off by saying I am a Mac person.  I was drawn to the design of the Chromebook.  It is very similar in design to the Macbook Air 11""  However it is certainly not a Macbook Air.  It feels heavier, although I didn't actually compare the weight.  It is definately thicker than an Air, and not as solid since it is plastic.  This brings me to my main issue, and why I only give it 4 starts instead of 5.  The trackpad is a great size, and has some swipe capability, although for some reason it basically limited to scrolling.  The issue, at least with mine, is that when you use this on your lap on the couch the body flexes enough while you type to create nuisance clicks with the touch pad.  I can literally flex the palm rests and the mouse will click.  The touch pad on mine is not quite even, so perhaps it is simply a defect.  The battery life is pretty good, I was so frustrated by the touchpad that I honestly haven't determined the run time of the battery.  I will say though, that it does kill the battery over time in sleep mode.  I closed the lid with about 50% battery left, and when I picked it up again to use it three days later the battery was dead.  I love the fact that it has a USB port and an HDMI port.  It think in time the OS will be even more functional, and if my touch pad is defective my main issue with the Chromebook would be no issue for most people.  If this is how the touchpad actually works, well then I give it ZERO stars.  It is so frustrating to use with the touchpad like this, that I could not possibly suggest it to anyone.  I have not tried the 3G, I returned it without ever testing that.

2070,"I've had my Chromebook for quite a while now, and I absolutely believe it was worth the price. I am a part-time college student earning an AA degree who writes fiction on the side and does a lot of surfing, Facebooking, Tweeting and YouTube-ing. I have used the Chrome browser for quite some time now, and so it was very easy for me to get to using my Chromebook right out of the box. Set up is EXTREMELY easy (I was surprised at how fast it was), and the boot up time is amazing. I've timed mine, and it never takes more than 5 seconds to be ready to go. It is more powerful than I expected it to be, but don't buy this if you're looking for a full capacity PC. I even connected my HTC One X+ via USB and it was able to handle set up and transfer with no problem. The weight is perfect for lugging around (I can carry it easily in one hand, and I can't usually handle many heavy things) and it fits snugly in my backpack. This thing weighs less than my French textbook! I have used it regularly for the past three days both at home and in the library at school. It's been a champ.Best for: anyone who wants a quick, easy, no-hassle way to browse, surf, Facebook, write and view YouTube.Not recommended for much gaming or anything like that. The keyboard is lovely to use, and it does take some time to get used to the layout, but as someone who regularly types 90-100WPM, I don't feel that my typing speed or accuracy has suffered AT ALL.I HIGHLY recommend this product to people like myself. The battery life and charge time is wonderful as well. Quick and no nonsense.-Review Written On My Chromebook! :-)

2073,"I have had my chromebook for about a week now and love it. The only cons I have experienced so far is first day I had it i did have the issue others had with it disconnecting from the internet and then the screen going blank but I just restarted it and it has been fine since so hopefully it will be okay now, also on the front right corner if I barley press down on it makes a plastic creaking sounds which is quite annoying. but other than that this thing is amazing and you should give it a try.

2076,"I bought this for my dad on a whim - I was tired of him pounding away on a 6 year old laptop that he keeps finding and replacing on E-Bay every time they die.  He's not OCD but sometimes I wonder if it'd be better if he was.  Easier to explain that kind of behavior.  When I asked him if he liked it about a week later he said ""It's great.  Absolutely everything I need to do I can do with this.""  Well, good enough for me.I only got to use it once or twice but it seemed like an Android based product - very familiar and easy to navigate.  Not to my taste as far as performance and utility but it definitely has a place in the market and for the price you can't beat it for a dedicated web browsing computer.

2086,"The laptop is wonderful.  It's lightweight, good internet connection (although there are times when my 700$ laptop will get internet but the Chromebook will not - but I think that's just because of my school's mediocre service at times, 95% of the time, it's fine), and good speakers.  The speakers are not the best (if you have a keen ear, or just listen side-by-side with something else) but most of the time I don't bother using better speakers.  If you don't like the Chrome OS, you can always install another one, too (like Ubuntu).  I was one of the first ones to get a Chromebook and people were concerned about the processing speed, but I frequently have 10 or more tabs open it doesn't seem to slow down.The light weight is definitely a plus, since you can easily hold it in one hand.

2124,"This laptop met all my needs:  Lightweight, compact, long lasting battery, and easy to use.I needed a lightweight laptop to carry around in school.  I didn't need a large 17"" screen or a massive hard drive.  I like how I can store all my docs, presentations, and spreadsheets in Google's cloud drive and if i need to transfer files this laptop has many external ports (USB 2.0, 3.0 and SD card).  Its compact size doesn't take up too much space in my backpack along with its lightweight which makes walking  around campus an easy task.  Half way through my semester, i noticed that the battery life last all day with note taking and web browsing.  This laptop is easy to use with all the standard adjustment buttons easily labeled.  My only gripe is the absence of the CAP LOCK button.  This procedure is enable cap locks is ALT, Google search button (located in same place as where the lock button should be).  There are too many times that i have brought up the search menu during lecture and continue to type not knowing that the search menu is waiting for me to click on an option.

Which are:- Seemingly weak WIFI antenna- It consumes battery very quickly. It wakes up very quick upon opening the lid, but the downside to that is that it seems within an few hours I have to recharge. Compared to a tablet experience, where it seems one can go days without having to charge.- Also there are a few plug-ins it won't install. For example, I cannot use Go To My PC because it won't install Java.I am considering buying one for my elementary age child, to write papers and surf for research.I applaud Google and Samsung's efforts. This is truly a step in the right direction.

The wide variety of web apps on Chrome Web Store makes you impossible to think you wasted your money.The laptop is most suitable for students since the apps provide sufficient functionality for school and college works and it is LIGHTNING FAST!The only downside is once you lost your internet connection, you are basically a ""sitting duck"" and this is why it is not so suitable for employees. But the problem will be solved soon since the HTML5 draft has been completed and many developers will start to make great web apps.

2139,"4 stars... because it's good, but not good hah!PROS:-$250 price. Literally the best price for a computer that you can find.-The weight. It's really light. It's portable, and yet still has a decently solid feel.-Keyboard. It's full sized and reminiscent of mac keyboards, not the best but it's nice that it is full-sized based off the size of the computer.-Battery life. Not sure what the other reviews said, but got mine to last 7 hours. No complaints here.-Quick Startup. absurdly so.-Basic straightforward layout. Not complicated at all.-Ability to open my other computer's previous browser tabs. That's actually surprisingly innovative and useful.CONS:-It isn't a computer. If you want a computer, then this isn't one. I'd suggest it only as a chromebook and a supplement to an existing computer.-Lack of customization or settings at all... it's frustrating, you literally cannot change anything you want to do... things that come to mind right now:1.It prompts a log in code when I turn it off and on again. (not sleep mode mind you) but since there is only one user I find this to be a waste of time.2.No battery or screen time settings. Sometimes the computer thinks it is idle and will shut off, even if I'm downloading or uploading large files.3.Chromebook has something written in it to make some website believe it is a mobile device. Which it certainly is not. NFL.com for example for some reason doesn't work when you link through the site to the rest of their site. No way to fix this right now.4.Essentially no hard drive or programs at all. They claim this app store, but in all reality it just links you through Chrome to other websites. For example, the news apps and video apps, simply open up the host website. Hulu app? No... it's just hulu.com. Same with Pandora, and countless others. Not apps, just a direct link to the website.5. No way to customize the keyboard. So while I can have different languages like Russian, I can only manually switch between keyboards rather than hit a button combo.-16 GB hard drive makes you rely on your 100 GB Google Drive Cloud, which is fine, unless you have large files and have to wait for downloading and uploading times.-You need internet always.-It scratches and is flimsy. It's been two weeks and it looks like it's been battered by a wolverine... Still works pristinely, but I can't help but think the material is a bit poor.-IT'S COMPLETE LACK OF ANY INNOVATION... it's just Chrome. Not an ounce more.The Point: It's $250, cheaper than pretty much everything. There's nothing like it in its class. It's solid though, it isn't a cheap device. It doesn't feel cheap is what I mean. However, DO NOT BUY if it's your only laptop, and do not expect it to replace your existing. But if you're like me and you need a light portable laptop on the go all day, and don't mind terrible lack of ability to do anything other than CHROME and GOOGLE DOCS. Then here you go.Mind you I love it. Just don't get your hopes up. It's just a browser. It's improved my productivity in situations where I would otherwise be bored, and has made me somewhat more efficient.

2152,"I have 4 other Chromebooks (the Series 5).  They all work flawlessly and beautifully.  I was hoping this would be great for the wife, smaller, lighter, thinner, and work just the same.It does not.  The first one I received constantly lost wifi connections.  It would hang seemingly endlessly trying to load the simplest of web pages.  Any other laptop, or another S5 chromebook beside it would bring it up in heartbeat.  I returned it thinking something was wrong.  Nope, the second one has the same issues.  There is something screwy & wrong with the wifi adapter in this.  No matter the strength, it simply cannot keep a connection.Unfortunately I will be returning this one too, it is simply defective.Chromebooks are GREAT, JUST NOT this model, get the other S5 model instead.

2153,"Just received the Samsung 11.6 Series 3 Chromebook.  It was constantly on back order on Amazon, so I just ordered it on Nov. 10th.  Nov. 16th I got an ETA of end of November delivery but it actually shipped Nov. 21st. Model-S/N sticker on the bottom has an Oct 2012 factory date.I ordered from Canada and used a cross border shipping service to get it here.  This added about $100 to the price, but a chunk of that was 13% HST taxes, there was no duty, and the shipping charge was fair, especially when you consider that Amazon did not charge a U.S. tax and shipping was free.So, if you want this and it says it's on back order, I recommend to just order it and you should get it fairly quickly.  And be sure to post a review.  These are new products and could disrupt the M$ and Apple's of the world, meaning greater choices for us through greater competition. Fair reviews are helpful in encouraging people to give this product a try. I think Google has a winner!This Samsung Chromebook performs flawlessly and *as advertised*.  Many lower ratings of this Chromebook on Amazon are actually rooted in buyers not doing a basic overview of this product before purchasing.  Most complaints are because you can't load Windows programs (.exe), they did not know this is essentially an internet kiosk with nearly everything residing in ""the cloud"" (No, it does not come with and you cannot install MS Word/Excel) or did not realize Netflix does not yet work (it will one day; be patient - consider it an ""early adopter tax"" and relax, knowing you're living on the ""bleeding edge"").This machine is simple and just works. Nothing complicated about it.  If you're a techie, you can move from the ""stable"" channel to ""beta"" or ""developer.""  Otherwise, just leave it the way it comes and it will simply work.-It boots fast, it shuts down fast and it browses fast. Boot and shut down is faster than any computer I have ever owned.-No viruses, so no need to purchase additional virus software.-Upgrades without any intervention.-Great battery life. Better than the 6.5 hour spec, in my case.-Having read all the reviews of the mediocre screen, I will say that it is better than I anticipated.  I have to turn down the brightness in a dark room.  Limited viewing angles but not an issue for me.  I like the matte screen, as there are no reflections. I would pay $50 more for a great IPS screen but this is perfectly fine, especially for a $250 laptop.-Great keyboard.  Really great keyboard.  Way better than my much sleeker, much more expensive ASUS Zenbook UX21 ultrabook or our our brick of a Dell laptop.  It has tonnes of available keyboard shortcuts.  People say that there is no delete key and you must do an alt+backspace (or something like that) to delete, but this is not my experience.  The backspace deletes the previous letter(s) you typed.  That's all I need it to do.  I love the integrated search/back/forward/reload/maximize keys.  Great modern additions.-No issues with the touchpad.  I'm not a touchpad fan at all (read: hate them); this one doesn't annoy me, which is saying a lot.  Two finger scrolling of pages is perfect.-small power cord.  No one ever mentions this in laptop reviews but it's important, and as many power cords are massive bricks, making it far less portable.-Be sure to buy a sleeve/case for this, as the plastic casing will scratch easily, no different than similar products (Have you ever seen a ""well used"" Macbook Air?  Not pretty).-Printing to my flaky HP eprint printer works flawlessly.TIP: I use Google's 2-step verification (multi-factor authentication), which I recommend everyone try out (use all the backup options when you set it up).  Be sure to try it for 30 days before making up your mind, as the extra sign on step takes getting used to.  If you use it, too, and want your Chromebook to be ""trusted"" (does not require a verification code every time you sign in) after providing the verification code the first time, under Settings > Users > Manage Other Users > check: Show Usernames and Photos on Sign-in Screen (default).  ** If you want to force a verification code every single boot (what I do), do NOT check: Show Usernames and Photos on Sign-in Screen.  This will require you enter your username, password and verification each time.  Warning: It will also require you to have internet access to sign in.These are good, solid little machines.  Google and Samsung have figured out a path to success.  Now, let's see if they can increase supply to match demand and then keep up the marketing effort to build market share.  I wouldn't touch the Acer model, though, and hope that Google keeps the price down without resorting to allowing bad pieces of hardware on to the market with this OS on it. First impressions count and bad hardware will hurt them in the long run.  They should be picky and this great Samsung Chromebook should become the minimum standard, not the gold standard.I plan to buy one or two for the kids to do their homework on after testing this for a few months, so they are not grabbing this one constantly. If it breaks, I can live with the $250 loss.  If it gets stolen, valuable documents will still be accessible in ""the cloud.""  The constant auto-save and previous versioning of Google docs has saved us numerous homework headaches.As far as first impressions for this Samsung Chromebook, it's great.  It just works, as it should.  No more, no less.  Faster than most machines and, hopefully, it will continue to improve rapidly, as people try out Chrome OS for the first time.This Samsung Chromebook is the sleeper hit of the year.Hope you found this review helpful.

2160,"I got a great deal on this Chromebook by buying it ""used"" from Amazon Warehouse Deals. I paid $134. It looked brand new when I opened the box. I don't think it was used at all. I was able to claim the 100GB Google Drive space, so that was a plus. I wasn't sure if I would be able to since I bought it used.I understand that a Chromebook isn't the same as a full-blown laptop. I did my research and read a lot of reviews before I placed my order. I don't understand why some people give bad reviews because they didn't know what they were buying. It isn't the fault of the product. Just do a little research before hitting the ""Add to Cart"" button.I love the size and that it is light and portable enough to carry in many of my pocketbooks. It is sleek and nice looking too.It does 90% of what I want and need to do on a daily basis. I can do online research, check email, write documents, watch movies, shop online, etc. When I want to rip/burn DVDs or convert books using Calibre I can always do that on my desktop or laptop.Netflix movies play perfectly for me. I tried several of them to make sure.Video files off my USB stick were hit or miss. I tested about 15 of them in a variety of file types (MP4, AVI and MKV). Some of each file type played and some didn't. I don't have a problem with that though because I didn't expect it to be a multimedia machine. I was actually surprised it played some of each file type. It wasn't advertised to do so. I will just be sure to test any video files ahead of time to make sure they play.The screen is more than fine for everyday use and watching movies. I don't see anything wrong with it and it is comfortable to look at and movies look great too. I'm not overly picky about that sort of thing though (except when it comes to TVs and my android phone screen).In many ways, it reminds me of my 4 year-old old Dell netbook except it is lighter and faster. The only real downside I can see (for some people) is the very limited storage space. I knew that going in though and it is a non-issue for me. I can just pop in a USB stick or download something from ""cloud"" storage. It also recognizes my Seagate external hard drive.The beautiful thing is there is virtually no lag time with anything it does. Lift the cover, push the Chrome icon and you're online. No sitting there twiddling your thumbs waiting for it to ""wake up"" from sleep mode. Web pages load almost instantaneously. It runs fast and smooth. Everything just flows.Even without an internet connection I can watch movies, type documents and listen to music. I couldn't be happier with my purchase. Especially for the price I paid!

2161,"I purchased the chromebook with it's use set in my mind.I am sort of an average joe tech fan (above average tech knowledge, but not on par with people who live an breath this stuff)Recently my macbook kicked the bucket (it was about 7 years old).  When searching for a new computer i wanted to really dig down and get an idea of what i used my macbook for.  Ultimately it all came down to web browsing.The Chromebook was a perfect choice for me because it gives me the essentials i look for in my computer usage.  IF you are looking for a computer in which you want to edit videos, save quite a bit of media, store your work... i would look in another direction.  But if you are like me, and just want something to browse the web with and view media...this is almost perfect.The price justifies the some of qualms i have with the computer (sometimes choppy playback, plastic feel, lower res camera) But as i stated.. for $250 this is a superstar.I highly recommend this for the average web browser!Feel free to post a comment on here if you have any questions.

2178,"I enjoyed it for the first couple of weeks.  It was a little underpowered- considering everything you do on a chromebook involves opening another browser tab or window- but it was OK for the most part.  The screen is not as clear or detailed as the Acer C710 in my opinion, but the matte finish does help with glare.  The problem came about when at some point, while watching a youtube video with two other tabs open, the video froze and I had to shut the computer completely off. I actually got it to power on again after trying repeatedly for a period of several days, but  by the time it finally decided to power on again, I had already processed the return.  After that It ran kind of ""funny"" having several hiccups and quirks- especially when running videos.  It was pretty good while it was working though, so maybe I just got a dud.  Oh well...  I ordered the Acer C720 to replace it, so we'll see how that goes.

The keyboard has excellent touch right out of the box and is adjustable too.  The tile key arrangement makes typing easy....never could get the hang of it with my Acer netbook.

This is not meant to be anything more than a cloud based computer that connects with Google apps like Docs and Calendar.  And with Google Docs continuing to get better, there is not as much a need to use Word anyway. It fires up in about 5 seconds and even starts off where you started if you just close the computer.The overall quality of the device is very solid.  It has a sleek look and the keyboard is great.  The only thing which would be a nice touch is if it were backlit.  The camera is so so, about the same as what you see on the earlier versions of the iPad.  You can watch Netflix through the Chrome browser, but the display is not super bright.  But having these features would drive the price up for this device.Overall I would recommend this product if you are looking for a portable device to perform web activities.

2184,"Long story short, I really enjoyed using a chromebook for school, but when it broke and needed repairs, Samsung voided my warranty after the product was damaged in the shipment to the repair center. SAMSUNG did everything it could to avoid paying for my repairs, to the point at which its justifications were laughable. Customer support was extremely condescending and insensitive. They even denied me the opportunity to speak to a manager in the hopes of expediting a repair process since it was finals week and I needed my laptop back. Instead, they effectively held my chromebook hostage during a critical time in my academic career.If you're a student and looking at chromebooks, don't make the same mistake I did by choosing SAMSUNG. Buy Acer or some other company's chromebook instead. You'll save yourself a lot of headaches working with SAMSUNG customer support in the event of a malfunction, especially if the malfunction occurs at a critical point in the semester.

2209,"First, I'll acknowledge up front that I've evaluated this Chromebook in the context of my kids who go to a school that uses google apps, and my own workplace which has also migrated to google apps as well. Were those factors not in play, I suppose I'd find this machine somewhat less useful.With this disclaimer out of the way, my bottom line is that I couldn't be happier with this purchase. I have a nice windows laptop, our family has a nice mac laptop at home, and we have ipad, kindle fire and google nexus 7 tablets. With all those choices, I naturally find myself picking this machine up first in the living room. Battery life is great, it's light, and it happens to do well 50% of what I like to do in random moments on a machine at home (the balance of my time I'm using a kindle paperwhite -- also a great product that simply works). My kids seem to be having the same experience with the chromebook as they look to do homework, etc. They are grabbing for this machine first as well.The same is true, to my surprise, at work. While some apps like powerpoint make me unable to envision actually giving up my laptop for work for probably several years to come, again I find myself naturally using the chromebook most of the time when both are up and running on my desk. The other interesting thing is how quickly my workflow is evolving. I can count on one hand how many times over the past several years I unplugged my laptop and brought it into a meeting. With this new machine, I find myself bringing it into meetings more often than not. I usually don't use it, but it's so light and so fast that it's a subconscious, cost-free decision to take it whether I end up using it or not.I'd encourage anyone to give this machine serious consideration. If you are in a google apps world, I'd encourage you to give this very, very serious consideration. I have some of the same misgivings others do about living too much in any one vendor's world (in my case, that's become Google), but that vague discomfort noted I'm nevertheless sold.

My only thought is that this is not a replacement for an actually laptop, this is a tool to carry with you while your 1,000$ laptop sits at home so no one steals it.

She had to get used to always connecting to wi-fi and going online using all the google chrome documents, but she has adjusted and everything is everything now.  The only complaint is that it should have a number pad along with being able to save word documents to the device and have internet connection without wi-fi.  I guess an upgrade to a full laptop would be the answer, but some accessibility to microsoft documents would be good... even if limited access.

2217,"This is my second Chromebook. The idea appeals to me because I have Google deeply integrated into my work life. I wanted to like this version but wish I could send it back. The first Chromebook I bought was a Samsung 12.5"" with an Atom processor. The same problem plagued that model as the newer version. Its too slow and the system strains under any load beyond the most basic work. In reference to the newer Samsung, one reviewer said that video runs fine as long as its less than 1080P. I find any video viewing to be irritating to deal with because it is so slow to start. The same reviewer wrote you could open 6 tabs at the same time without degrading performance. I have not found that to be true. The track pad is better on the new model than the old one but still falls short in smooth and accurate performance. I like the keyboard on both models except for the the lack of a forward erasure key. From a layman's perspective it seems to me this unit would profit greatly from a better processor and/or more memory. Perhaps that would require a fan. I think consumers interested in this concept would pay another $100 if it worked properly. The result is this is another Chromebook that misses the mark. I understand the Pixel Model addresses most or all these problems but at its price I would opt for a Macbook Air.

2222,"This is a great little laptop to have if you want to browse the web, listen to music and watch movies.  I have a serious workhorse computer, I didn't want that.  I wanted something fun to pull up recipes, slip into my purse and play on Facebook.  This laptop does that very well, with a great battery life for its size.  The speakers sound really great and they do get loud without distorting the sounds of the music.  I have watched videos, chatted via webcam and the best part, set the whole thing up in less than 5 minutes.  Including having to remember the password to connect to my WiFi.- The look of this laptop is sleek and stylish, and Amazon offers tons of fun skins to stick on when I get bored of the silver finish.- The keyboard is very comfortable to type on and the keys are spaced very nicely.  Even my large handed husband can type on it with little difficulty.- The scroll/mouse pad is very responsive.  It did take me a bit of time to learn the finger lingo for the laptop though.  I found a tutorial on Google that outlined how to left click and scroll very easily.Left click - tap two fingertips on the mouse.Scroll - move two fingertips over the mouse, either up or down.- The screen is very true to color and offers very crisp views of text and images.There is just one con and I am not sure whose fault it is but there is no Skype.  No Skype app and no pre-installed Skype function.  They do provide something for you to use to chat via cam but it's not as good or as widely used as Skype.  So either Skype needs to get on the ball and make a Chrome App or Google needs to add something to their Webstore.Still even with that small con, this is an excellent laptop to goof off on and I am extremely happy with it overall.**Parents with young kids, the laptop finish has proven to be teething and sticky finger print proof.  Which is always a bonus for me!*

I am simply going to say what my research didn't tell me about the Chromebook in hopes of helping others.1- NO Netflix support. Though this maybe coming in the future as of the end of 2012 it is unavailable.2- Bluetooth is only available for mice & keyboards. NO AUDIO. Again this may change with upcoming updates but not as of the end of 2012.3- The charger is neither usb nor mini usb. This was shocking as I automatically concluded that it would charge in at least 1 of those 2 types.That's all. Very good for what it does but with just a little more effort it could have become something spectacular.

I don't know because I could not find a way to check my bandwidth usage! So I decided to upgrade to a paid plan 4GB per month and got a message that it may take 15 minutes to activate, I waited but it never worked and mysteriously I was getting ""no network"" message when I previously had network connection but no access. So I turned it off (didn't get to use it for the whole ride) when I got into work I opened up my chromebook to see if my paid plan was working, and my chromebook wouldn't turn on or off. The power light was on with just got a black screen, I couldn't turn it on or off. I found a help thread that said to push the pinhole button on the bottom and that worked but you can't turn the chromebook back on until it's connected to a power adapter which I left at home because I don't need to lug it around since the chromebook has good battery life right?

Also, try out the chrome extensions you think you might use before you buy one, but my guess is that you'll fall in love with this thing and be willing to make a few application/workflow changes to work with what is available out there.

The battery life is amazing, it charges really fast, and it looks pretty good. There are problems with the viewing angles and the webcam is a bit crappy. Also, Samsung just glued its name on the cover so just be careful with how you transport it because the logo may fall off.

Up and running in less than 2 minutes with a 75% charge even though they say its not charged.I was disappointed when I could not get Amazon Prime unlimited videos on it, then with a little searching it appeared to be an Amazon issue, not Chrome. Today it is fixed for me and everything works. If you use Gogo inflight and google drive, then the price to you will be about $20 to buy this device. I just got back from a trip to DC and the 1 segment price for gogo at a value price was $10 for 3 hours. I was on my 11"" mac air.  This device appears to come with 12 GoGo passes to be used before 2015 (12 x $10=$120). It also comes with 100 gb of Google drive. Google drive is $5 a month for 100 GB of storage. So if you put the 12 GoGo passes ($120) and two years of google drive 100 gb a month ($120) that makes this machine cost $20. You can do the math for yourself if you do not think you will use either google drive or gogo. After using my mac air for 2.5 hours, and now using this machine to write this review, the feel is similar. I like it. YMMV.

2303,"I chose the Samsung Chromebook because our IT dept. had tested them out and found them to be quick and have long battery life. I only need it for my personal use, not for business and I do love it. It is lightweight, fast and does have a long battery life.

2304,"A little background:  I've had the same PC laptop for almost 4 years.  It's too bulky, runs loud, battery no longer charges (yes, i know that's fixable), youtube video's sometimes take long to load while my roomates computers have no issues (yes, i realize it's probably fixable, but ive had it 4 years, time to move on).  Anyway, i wanted to go back to a small laptop.  I really only use my laptop to browse the internet.  with Spotify, i don't really buy/download new music anymore as it has become more of a hassle than it's worth, when i could just pay spotify $10 a month to listen to any music i want, and create offline playlists.  So since i don't necessary need the computer to do anything but surf the internet.  I like having a keyboard because i prefer to type instead of how it's done on a tablet.  i also like it to rest on lap and not have to hold the tablet.  So that brought me to the Samsung Google Chromebook.When i first got the chromebook, i was not able to log in to my gmail account my password had capital letters at first.  So i had to use another computer to change my password before i was able to login.  no big deal, i just thought it was odd.Our wifi service through ATT only provides 12mbps download speed.  Yes, i know this is low, but what can you do?  Our apartment is old and cannot get cable, only DSL.  So i immediately performed a speed test (Speedtest.net), and i was only receiving a max of 3 mbps download speed!  I performed a test on my phone with connected to my wifi, and i got about 11 mbps.  my roomates tried on their macbooks and phones and also received about 11mbps, along with my old PC.  I searched forums to see if i could find a solution, thinking it may bet an issue with a setting on my wifi network.  I found this forum [...] and tried all suggestions in this forum, to no avail.  I brought my chromebook to work the next day and received 15mbps, while my work laptop and my phone connected to the same wifi, both received over 30mbps!!!  Now, i know it's not my home wifi, it seems to be any wifi.I called samsung, and the guy immediately said there is a problem with the wifi card.  he said there is no reason it should be slower than other devices on the same network.  Didn't even try to troubleshoot.  he said i need to send it in for repairs.  But since i bought it on amazon, i called them and they shipped me a replacement two days later (amazon, you are rockstars!).  I received the new chromebook at work and tested the speed.  Guess what?  only 15mbps, while my other devices received over 30mbps.  So now i know it was not a malfunction with the original chromebook i received.I love the chromebooks concept.  If I did not have this wifi issue, then i would complete give this 5 stars as it suits my needs.  But i'm not going to open a youtube video and have to press pause while it loads so i can watch the video without interruptions.  I refuse to do that, as that was one of the main reasons i wanted a new laptop to begin with.Normal browsing the internet is fine, but when it comes to playing videos on youtube, it's horrible!  I even tried watching youtube videos at work, where i did receive faster download speed, and still the videos took long to load and were choppy.  Not satisfied at all.Thanks to amazon, i'm sending this back and receiving a full refund.  I've never had a apple computer, but once i receive the refund for the chromebook, i will be ordering the 11.6 inch macbook air.I wish my review would be good, but unfortunately, i'm not satisfied.If you don't watch videos online, then you can't really beat this device as far as price goes.I would give 5 stars on this product if there wasn't this wifi issue.  IT'S A WIFI MACHINE, WHY IS IT NOT AS FAST AS MY OTHER DEVICES??Still a fan of Google, but this one didn't work out for me.Thanks for reading!

2312,"First, the ""100 mb free"" internet is not. They charge for set up, and a monthly account fee. I would not have paid for the 3g version had I known this. I would have saved the money and used my hotspot.Many of the apps I was shown in the store do not work on this device. Specifically, slingbox does not work with this device. One of the main reasons I purchased it.The device would be a pretty good idea, but the deception used to sell it, coupled with the limited functionality, are enough to make me return the device. Really too bad, I looked forward to using it. Very disappointed. One good thing. I have eagerly awaited glass. Based on this device and the deceptive mnner in which it is marketed, I will save my $1500.Update: Since I cannot return this thing because it does not meet Amazon's return policy (it's not dead"") I guess I am stuck with it. Do your homework before buying. Do it on your own. Samsung contacted me to deny the product is misrepresented, but offered no explanation for the misrepresentation. If that sounds confusing, it is. The ""free"" 3g is in fact NOT free. It does NOT allow use of slingplayer or many other apps.Also no Skype app. Another deception about the product. When shown at BestBuy the floor model wasn't working because the battery was dead and they could not find a plug. Salesman assured me there was a Skype app. I now officially hate this thing

2314,"First, know what you are purchasing.  The Chromebook is a very quick and efficient way to get online quickly.  Think tablet with a keyboard.  Now for the huge bonus to the Chromebook.  You will not have issues with incompatible video formats because they are not supported by mobile.  You are really considered as a laptop so you can access all the same things.  The device is light, easy, fast and prices very well.  If you use Google gmail, docs and other services, they are all ready to go.  Want something different, go to any online site and use their service.  Another great feature is the guest option.  If someone wants to get online real quick, just hand them the chromebook and click guest.  A browser is launched and they are browsing privately with no setup.  There is also a multi port that allows me to upload photos and files from all the different memory cards I have.  You can also connect directly to your high def TV using the HDMI jack on the back.  This is the best purchase I've made in many years.  It was just going to be a short term solution for us but now we have converted to Chromebook users.  No virus problems, 6 seconds to boot, mobile, light... or, and the setup is just open the top and log into your account.  There are a few setup steps to review your options and you are up and running.  I could send this to my grandmother with no instructions and she could use it.

I chose this one because I liked its keyboard the best and, since it needs no cooling fan, it operates in complete silence.I have now bought two of these: one as a gift for a family member and then one for me. They were simple to set up and they work very well with very little effort. They are lightweight, inexpensive, and all the positive things you've read in other reviews here are true.Update 16 Feb 2014:Months in, and my enthusiasm for the Chrome OS platform and this Samsung Chromebook has not diminished. Still working flawlessly, and updates to the OS and apps offered for it have made it even better than when new. I'm using the Chrome Remote Desktop to access my PC and network at my job, and couldn't be happier with it. Google Drive, Docs, and Sheets have completely replaced MS Office for me, and I can share documents and data with my iPad and iPhone via iWork for iCloud. If you are looking for a new computer, seriously, look at a this or another Chromebook first.

2351,"The laptop looks fancy.  I couldn't wait to play with it.  My overall feeling is that for $250 this is an incredible device.My wife and I are cable cutters and we have a Home Theater PC which is always on.  A chromebook probably wouldn't cut it if we didn't have the PC to remote into, but for us it is perfect.  Googling or researching on the couch with our Nexus 7 can become a hassle and chrome is just not the same on the tablet.  If you are like us, you unsleep the monitor of your computer and the first thing you click is chrome to load up facebook, news, and amazon.  This device is perfect for accessing the web via chrome.  With its extensions I have google voice, photoshop, VNC, and more.I deeply recommend that you become familiar with what a chromebook is and what its capabilities are before purchasing.  I obviously didn't expect to be able to install Microsoft Office on this little beast.  The bad reviews here are basically because people were expecting things that the OS cannot do (unless you flash ubuntu on it).I will say the only negative thing is that the touchpad feels a little cheap.  Sometimes it doesn't register clicks when I expect it to, and clicking it all the way down is clunky.  It isn't enough to drop it to 4 stars imo.  I would give 4.5 if i could have.Tips:-If you don't know what a chromebook is or don't regularly use chrome as your browser..... DON'T BUY without researching.-If you want an incredibly simple to use couch-surfing portable laptop, you love chrome, and you know what to expect out of a chromebook... then this device offers the best value for any laptop available this 2012 holiday season.  If you can find it in stock.... BUY IT.

2354,"I could not be more happy with this product. It is absolutely fabulous. I have been using it every day for over week now. It really can do just about anything my laptop could do, as well as my desktop.  A desktop is required for storage, burning DVD's and the like as there is no optical drive on the Chromebook. The hard drive is also very small, by today's standards.However, with the available Chrome extensions; tasks such as documents, spread sheets, reading books and basic computer games are all a breeze. Not to mention of course, the internet and email.Battery life is amazing. Upon getting it, I charged it, once it was fully charged, it lasted 2-1/2 days of off and on use for hours at a time - battery was down to 34%. Charging it is also quite fast. At that point, it took 1-1/2 hours to fully charge *while* using it!Set up? There is none. Turn it on, if you are good to go. If you are already a Chrome user, everything is right there for you. There are some minor adjustments/tweaking you can make such as desktop background, font size and scrolling method. It really could not be more simple.The screen size, 11.7"" is quite adequate, the touch pad is HUGE and very easy to navigate even for me who has always had a problem using touch pads. Not with this. It takes a few times to learn the finger(s) gestures for right click type commands, but from then on, it's a breeze. I did try using a USB mouse and it worked, but it was a bit sluggish. But again, it is quite easy to navigate using the touchpad and I really have not needed to use a mouse.At 2.4 pounds and less than 1/2"" thick, I am looking forward to putting this in my backpack on my next vacation as opposed to the Netbook or laptop!  I had read some reviews that the case scratches easily? So far, I've not found that to be true. But then, I am not a child and do use care when using my electronics. I bought the Case Logic LAPS-111 sleeve and it fits snugly and was a good investment since it doesn't add much to the size of the Chromebook, yet offers more than enough protection.Two days after getting this, I sold my laptop and Netbook - there was no need for either. I love that as soon as you open the lid,it is instant on. I really cannot say enough good things about this product.  If you're on the fence about buying one of these? JUMP, you won't regret it.

No fan means it runs silent, and I find it runs cool enough to leave on bed or couch without  any fears of over heating. ultimately gives a $500 feel for $250. It really is just a web browser, so no software to speak of, most of the apps not much more than saved links to webpages. It will take a while to get out of the windows mindset, but I do not think the chrome OS will limit me too much. Might even end up better off if developers ever catch up and google adapts for more software options.

We print using google cloud print so that worked out of the box too.One tip, if you get the 3G version, you can only activate verizon a day after you start using the chromebook. We have two for our family and it was the same both times. The 3G speeds are passable if you need to do some simple browsing in a pinch. Again, exactly what I wanted.

It has a super quick startup, the keyboard is perfect- even my fiance uses it with no problem and he loves it too! I can use the ""cloud"" to get word processing documents and spreadsheets.

2397,"I've had the Samsung Chromebook for a couple of weeks now and there is no other way to put it- I'm hooked. It's fast, simple and above all very intuitive. That isn't to say there aren't adjustments to be made in using a Chromebook as opposed to a PC laptop- there are. That said, there are adjustments to made when moving from an SUV to a two seater car. The real question becomes are the adjustments worth the change. In the case of the Samsung Chromebook, the answer is absolutely.If real work needs to be done the Chromebook offers speed, an elegant and clean interface and superb functionality, all essential to full time road warriors, part time road warriors and stay at home anyone's who need connectivity and the day to day functionality of a computer without the need for 24/7 video game playing, movie editing, sound mixing, CAD or anything else the rest of us in the the real world trenches do not engage in, then this is the machine for you.I have salubrious contempt for anyone who denigrates the idea of the Samsung Chromebook. It does exactly what it i supposed to do and does better than expected. Finding fault with this product and it's intended user and use is like finding fault with an Aston Martin because you don't like the color of the vehicle.As far as I am concerned, the verdict on the Samsung Chromebook is in: I am happily hooked on the product. I've got Chrome's Disease and I couldn't be happier.

2400,"So I am a heavy chromebook user. I have/had the first Samsung chromebook, Chromebox, 550, and now just received the new $249 Chromebook today.For $249 it is a steal. Great looks (80% of a Macbook Air). I wanted to focus this review to give insight to people already using other chromebooks.1) Screen - The screen is nothing like the first 2 versions from Samsung. This is a cheaper screen that is very noticeable side by side. Many others mention about the viewing angle losing brightness, I agree. I also have a cloudy into (almost the wrong hue) on my screen. Very similar to my first notebook in 1998. Samsung, if you have a better option -please use it. This is the most glaring thing versus the 550.2) Design - LOVE IT! After comparing the two, I want the screen of the 550 pushed into the form factor of this new one. Measurably more thin without the rounded plastic feel that has dogged the first two Samsung chromebooks.3) Sound - It is like going back to the original Samsung chromebook. Almost half the volume of the 550. Ok, but don't expect the volume.4) Speed - Do not notice issues here.In summary, I would love if they made an option for $50-$100 more with a 12.5"" - 13"" higher quality screen (seems like enough room, as there is a large bezel around this new one). Also wished they would upgrade the speakers and volume. Put these two things into the current size and design and you have a STRONG business/higher end machine (for $299-$349, no more $449 chromebooks please as it defeats the purpose). That said, this is a great value for what it is and I strongly feel every house should have this laying around (you will use it more then a tablet). I just wish they had a higher quality machine like the 550 in this design (at a lower price point).

The mouse took a little while to get used to, but now I can't imagine using any other laptop mouse.I was a little worried/skeptical of the Chrome operating system, but it's exactly what I need. It's easy to use, and since everything is cloud based I don't have to worry about not having that necessary document on every computer I touch.I wouldn't reccomend this to everyone, in fact, I told my partner not to get one, but he NEEDED a pc, not a Chromebook. But if you are looking for cheap, easy-to-use, and are ok with being cloud based, then this is for you. If you need to run programs in windows, then this isn't for you, but you probably already know that.

2404,"The Samsung Chromebook is a great machine and does well filling the gray area between smart phones and traditional computers. I did quite a bit of research before purchasing this and I will say that I had not yet leaped into the cloud-mentality. The Chromebook changed that.There are many naysayers out there for this device, but the technology behind the Chromebook is both impressive and effective. You will also see reviews pushing the notion that a Chromebook is an expensive web browser. There is a quarter-ounce of truth to this, but should not be a slogan by any means.The Chromebook is perfect for portability. There are zero moving parts in its internal components. You never have to update software. Classic access to Google Drive/Docs is the same. Google's office-software acquisitions as of late should indicate more robust features are coming. Standard keyboard with some new (and worthwhile) tricks you'll have to learn. Stretch out those puffy, Vienna sausage fingers if you've spent any time on a netbook. Also, you will not get a virus or accumulate piston-ceasing malware that has once again seeped through your McAfee.When many take a hard look at what they do, a majority of the time everything is web-based anyway. Not for everyone, though, so completely understandable. Think about what you need and what you do. This is not a graphics, design, or media editing powerhouse. It is a light device for getting to job done on the go. Are you a blogger, coder, editor, emailer, surfer, reader, or Pandora-er? You are covered. Yes, its common model is wifi only and there are complaints about that. However, almost anyone with a smartphone these days can create a secure hotspot, and bam, Bob's your uncle. Your free 2400-baud Starbucks wifi node is now your backup plan.Wait, who mentioned Netflix?! Netflix works on Chromebooks as of March 12, 2013. If you did not know that, then buy a Chromebook and sign up for Twitter too. See you in cloudspace...

It was a little strange navigating the Chrome OS at first, but after about 10 minutes and a surprisingly helpful tutorial I was flying around pretty well. It should be said that I am fairly familiar with most of the Google apps and the Chrome browser. My 63 year old mother, however, is not. But, most of the apps are super simple to use and I have not received a single tech support question.

Screen brightness is good. The viewing angle is ok. Battery life is excellent. It does not get hot at all. I haven't used much of anything else on it, except for surfing the net. I use it everyday and have not had a glitch. My only complaint is that is does not support Java. I need it for my Etrade platform. I had to buy another laptop just for that. But this thing is so light and portable, I bring it with me everywhere. Internet is still very fast, running off the Wi-Fi on my phone. I wouldn't worry about buying a used one from Amazon. Based on what i've seen from other reviews, people return them because they need more space or Java, not because there was anything wrong with it. Mine was just like brand new when I got it. Amazon is really good with returns, if there would have been something wrong with it. Get it you'll like it.

However, she now reports that the unit was accidentally dropped from a height of 2-3 inches onto a thickly carpeted floor-- and now has a cracked screen. After a cursory search online, cracked screens (some 'spontaneous' and not related to any mistreatment or accidental damage) appear to be an issue with the Samsung Chromebook (and not with other Chromebook brands). It appears that it is not covered under the warranty. A do-it-yourself screen replacement runs about $75.00.  Unsure if we will get the screen replacement or spring for a new Acer Chromebook.

For me, as I move a lot and work always with internet. It is PERFECT. As a journalist, I need a light, fast and easy-to-use computer. And this chromebook is great because it's based on Google Chrome, a web brouser. That means you don't have to move between different interface.

2418,"We were really excited about this Chromebook. It's truly a beautiful machine. Very light. Very well designed generally and looks and feels much like a clone of a MacBook Air. Excellent keyboard. The Chrome operating system is what it is: a good idea for some people and maybe not really that terrific for others.Apparently, these little machines are flying off the shelves because we had to wait for ours for a while, even with a Prime purchase.Anyway, we were disappointed. We wanted so badly for it to work, it was quite the downer that it seems not quite ready for primetime. Or, to put it somewhat differently, it has a problem which a $250 consumer item shouldn't have: connectivity is very problematic.The short version of this is that a machine that requires that it be online for any significant functioning had better not have any issues about getting online. Ours did, and bad issues at that. In retrospect, we realize we disregarded warnings about connectivity, which appear quite frequently in reviews of this machine online. Of course, one never knows with such things what the level of expertise of the reviewer might be and all the time you see reviews essentially announcing that the reviewer is a complete novice and maybe should be asking his teenage son how to do things instead of complaining about the item being reviewed.Our home is served by an recent Airport Extreme wireless router. There are many items connected and none have ever had a problem. Indeed, my students will frequently visit our house with their many varied laptops and none of them has ever had a problem connecting to the system. But this Chromebook refused completely. By the way, it had no trouble at all with connecting to our neighbors unprotected network through walls and down the street so if it's a hardware issue it certainly isn't a simple one of an obviously defective part.My wife works in IT tech support so she toyed with the idea of taking our network apart to find what sort of gremlin might be locking out this one machine out of all the dozens that have connected flawlessly. Of course it was my spousal responsibility to be sure that she would be able to do that successfully, but that left me wondering about whether I could just take her along wherever I took the machine, to fix up similar mysterious refusals to connect.I don't want to seem cranky about this, since we both really liked the machine and even though we packed it up and sent it back to Amazon, our plan is to lurk, giving Samsung and Chrome a bit more time to bring their product up to speed. Then we'll try again. But, for right now our verdict is that a machine aimed at the low end consumer market shouldn't have even the slightest issue of the sort we encountered.Oh, we aren't claiming that our experience is typical. We didn't push deeply into our configuration. We certainly didn't remap our entire network or pull items off one by one etc etc. The point, again, is that no one should have to do that for an always online consumer laptop.

The track pad is slightly above OK (can support multiple finger touch no problem), the screen was surprisingly good ( but not amazing ). The OS is not bad at all. When you think about what you do on a normal basis, a browser can probably do it. To make it even more powerful Google has a Chrome app called remote desktop where you can remote into your home/powerful machine and just perform everything there. The battery life is also very acceptable. with normal use you can squeeze out a good 4-6 hours. No problem with maintenance either since everything is cloud based.Additionally, the perks that come with it (100GB drive storage, gogo, and other stuff) is a nice little extra they throw in.For the geeks, this is supported by Arch ARM (as it runs ARM architecture) and you can dual boot and have great developer options to play around.If you have constant access to the internet this piece of hardware will be suprisingly

2426,"I bought the Chromebook primarily for doing note taking in class since my old laptop is bulky and has a horrible battery life. Love the long battery life this thing has. Only real complaints I have is the keyboard and the Google Drive 100 GB offer. The keyboard feels like it's cheap and going to break any second. My other complaint is that Google won't give the 100GB chromebook storage offer to this particular Chromebook for whatever reason. I was hoping to have the storage for this since it's so small but now I'm going to have to use flash drives and NAS storage. Other than that though, it's been great. Oh and if you're a Linux power user, don't try to get SteamOS on this thing like I did. It's never going to happen unfortunately.EDIT: Turns out their Google Drive redemption thing was just not working correctly, I got it.EDIT 2: After a few months the space bar seems to be going. It doesn't feel like it was when I first got the chromebook, now it feels like I'm pressing against a firm plastic thing.EDIT 3: Now one of the speakers is behaving strangely. Now when it's too loud it vibrates the plastic itself making this horrible sound. It's solved by lowering the volume or holding down the side with the speaker but it's kinda sad that it's just starting to do this for really no real reason.EDIT 4 5/26/2014: Now the door for the SD card bay just broke for no reason. I've only used it once so it's not like the hinge gave out. I'm now giving this two stars. Really disappointed in Samsung for all the shortcuts they've taken with this. Get the Acer C7 instead.

Also I tried to play a 300mg video file locally instead of via the web and it took 4-5 min to load. After that it would only play sound and not display video. For those 2 reasons I could not give it 5 stars.Having said that, am I no way disappointed with this device, as I am currently driving down the road connected to my phone writing this review. (I should prolly clarify say that I wasnt actually driving. My wife was and I was in the passenger seat. Apparently some people are dumb enough to think otherwise.......) The touchpad is great, however it did take me a few min to get used to the gestures that I am not used to. (2 finger swipe and the touchpad actually clicks) This is a very nice compact machine. I will feel so much more comfortable carrying this around school as opposed to my 2000 Alienware laptop...Much more portable.I have heard people complain about the display and it not being bright enough, however it is a sunny day as we drive down the road and I can see the screen very clear.The Keyboard is top notch and the star of this device. While made entirely of plastic it does feel cheap at all. I am comfortable picking it up by the corner without a fear of it breaking. Connecting to a TV via the HDMI is as simple as plugging it in. If Google can fix the local playback issue and get the few games such as Angry Birds to play better, then I would for sure give this thing 5 stars.If you have a need for portability and a cloud based device, this is the device for you, especially with it being priced at $249.

With that being said there are limitations. If you can't find you printers drivers to download on the cloud then sorry cant use that printer anymore. No .exe files can be saved, so anything you want to download that is not available in the chrome store is a no go.

I bought mine thinking it would be something akin to a real computer and I've been unpleasantly surprised ever since when I wanted to do things like play games, write documents, experiment with doing simple coding etc.  The other big problem I have with it is that it is a continuation of the Google tracking model where they collect your personal data and send it out to third parties for profit.  There's a free OS out there called Chromium which the Google modify for these systems so that it syncs in with the wider Google complex allowing them to track you better.  If you don't like large corporations tracking your every move on the net and want a real computer that can run real computer programs, I don't really recommend this.

2515,"I am director of a small publishing house. I've been using a $1,000 MacBook Pro 11.6 (Lion) laptop for over a year, with the Chrome browser, Gmail, and GoogleDrive as my online backup for laptop-based files of importance. I got accustomed to the trackpad (I switched the scrolling direction) and haven't used a mouse since I got my Mac. I do book production and cover design on it, sitting in the living room recliner (too far from an electrical outlet to use the adapter) but the battery runs down pretty quickly.I wanted this Chromebook as a second machine for starting and ending my day: browsing and doing the cloud-based work I have to do, like accounting in Wave, managing social network-based marketing, ordering books, searching for cover art, reading manuscripts in Submittable, handling email, etc. My Mac with Adobe CS5 is essential for the actual book design and production, so I basically reserve its battery now for that.What is amazing to me is how similar this Chromebook keyboard is to my MacBook Pro. The only time I realize I'm not on my Mac is when I hit what, on the Mac, is the caps lock key but on the Chromebook pops up apps. (There is no caps lock key on the Chromebook; supposedly you can press both shift keys at the same time to effect caps lock, but I guess I don't have the right touch because I can't get it to work.) Another slight difference is in how click and drag works; on the Chromebook, you hit the trackpad with your thumb, then drag.Those who have already gotten accustomed to using Google-related commands for email, clearing the cache, and the like will be good to go without any learning curve. Chrome extensions and apps, of course, work as expected. (I am SO glad I had the prescience to realize a year ago that I definitely wanted to shift to a cloud-based approach!)Now, a word about the quality of the monitor. I find the type on the screen to be MORE readable than on my Mac. It is much crisper and high-definition. The colors don't match between the two computers, but I'm not sure it's the Chromebook's fault. The Chromebook does seem to be able to sense how to adjust brightness based on the conditions of the room, which is helpful. Sometimes, however, my eyes start smarting, something that happens when I'm working on the Chromebook, but not on the MacBook Pro. I don't know what accounts for this. The sound is better on the Chromebook than on my Mac, especially if I use good headphones. When watching a movie, the color is a bit washed out compared to the really garishly brightly colored sets, but I prefer that.I'm probably more of a power user when it comes to the user end of a computer, but I don't try to get in and hack things like some people do. Developer mode, need for static IP address, etc., I'm clueless about. But this is a well-built, fast, mostly no-fuss, low-cost and very light-weight piece of work with a long-lasting battery, which is exactly what I wanted. That I also got a seamless experience shifting from one machine to the other for a quarter of what my MacBook Pro cost? That's priceless!

2518,"I purchased 3 of these chromebooks for my office staff and chose the 3G version, as an added cost, specifically so that they could work outside the office in client locations without resorting to using the client's wifi connections.  We setup the Verizon accounts for the 3G feature without issue.  Then came the field use. One word - deplorable connectivity. Verizon 3G is simply not reliable.  We contacted our tech team, and the quick solution was to use our Verizon phones (4G LTE) mobile hotspot feature to enable the connectivity we need for the chromebook.  Money spent by getting the 3G version was a complete waste.  We could have spent less with the wifi version of these chromebooks and this would have sufficed.Very disappointed.Please understand, my gripe is not with the chromebook itself - they work just fine.  It is with the ""upgrade"" 3G option which does not work at all.

2528,"For a product that's supposed to work out of the box, this has been a time consuming hassle. When trying to activate my Verizon account, I got an error message telling me my device could not be activated. Next came the following 7 day process:1. 40 minutes alternating between hold and a very confused Verizon rep2. Two hours of research and an attempt to correct the problem myself3. 2nd call to Verizon to request a check that my machine is in the system. Discovered it was not and that they couldn't enter the data for me.4. Track down contact info for a Chrome Ninja, fill out form, wait to be contacted.5. Call from Chrome Ninja where we conferenced in with Verizon and got my data put in the system. Was told I'd have to wait up to 72 hours to activate.6. Tried every 24 hours until the 72 was up and failed to activate.7. Called Verizon to see if my number was in there. It was not. They still couldn't help and told me to contact the Chrome Ninja again.8. Waited two days to hear back from my Ninja since I emailed on his weekend.9. Call from Ninja with Verizon again. Told to wait 24 hours.10. Success! Finally!I understand this is rare and that I got that tiny percentage that slips through the cracks. My warning to 3G buyers: If your Verizon account won't activate, do not waste any time calling Verizon. Go straight to the Chrome Ninja and have them handle it.Aside from the unexpected difficulty of activating my Verizon account, my experience with the Chromebook has been extremely positive. It's exactly what I was looking for: a secondary to my bulky laptop that I can cart about easily to quickly access the internet.

Beyond 20 tabs in Chrome, the strain shows, and there's obvious lag in performance.As a college student, I love the Chromebook. It's slick, shiny, and simple. However, I got it as a complement and life lengthen-er to my very standard laptop. I could use this as my main device, and ditch the laptop, but I'd really rather not.

However, the battery is less than full charging now and the chat live at Samsung will walk you through lots of stpes but nothing works.  I finally requested service which is what to do first time, however, you will pay to ship it after getting service info online.  You must register the product.  After dealing with such good service at Toshiba and ATT all these years, this is an issue.  Although it is a nice laptop, will not buy it again because of the service.  Too complicated to return and also takes lots of calls to get it repaired.  Nothing made to last, and although I have a Samsung cell phone, know dealing with ATT will be much easier than dealing directly with Samsung.

2547,"22 MAY 2013 Update: Yesterday the Chromebook became completely dysfunctional.  After two months of having nothing but praise for the computer, now it doesn't work. When I'm fortunate to even log on, the laptop freezes constantly. I cannot even complete the ""Powerwash"", as the Chromebook will only restart and take me back to the log-in screen, only to then freeze again. I've tried switching from ""Stable"" channel to ""Beta"" channel to escape the bug, but to no avail. This computer is done for. Unfortunately for me, Amazon cannot accept returns on computers more than 30 days after purchase, so my only hope is to try a return through the manufacturer.From what I can find online, it seems this bug is not an isolated event; I would caution against buying a Chromebook - you'll get what you pay for. For me, this laptop deserves no more than 1 star - I paid $250 for two good months. Now I'll be lucky if the manufacturer will accept the return.Below is my initial 4-star review:This is generally a good laptop. It's a laptop designed for the Cloud, so keep that in mind when considering to buy; that is, one is meant to store music, documents, photos, etc. in online sources (Google Play, Drive, Calendar, etc.) and not meant to store significant amounts of data on the computer itself. I'd give it 4 1/2 or 5 stars if it didn't have two glaring deficiencies:1. The home key markers (on the ""F"" and ""J"" keys) are barely noticeable. To go along with this, since the keyboard isn't back-lit, the home keys become that much more important to orient oneself when typing. The letters/numbers/symbols on every key are slightly raised and feel no different than the ""markers"" on the home keys.1a. While I'm at it, the keyboard isn't back-lit.2. The high contrast setting distorts pictures - all pictures, online or stored locally.

2557,"I was looking for a compact solution for internet browsing and a means for viewing and copying my photos during an extended overseas trip. I was limited by the fact that my camera uses CF cards so I was looking for USB ports and I wanted to keep the price <$300.On the good side - the Chromebook includes multiple USB ports, including a 3.0; it is lightweight, has a full-size keyboard, starts instantly, and is less than $250. It was easy to pop it out during a bus trip, with good browsing capabilities.On the downside - you need internet access in order to log on, so don't EVER log off if you are going to be off the grid! I was traveling to remote locations in Africa and did not have consistent internet access. The Chromebook verifies your identity via the internet, so your only option without internet is to log on as a guest. then you can't use your off-line apps, etc. Also, you can only download apps specific to Google Chrome, seriously diminishing the options available. Oh, and my desire to view photos...PAINFUL!!!! My older version Canon SLR takes photos only 3-4MB and the Chromebook took forever to open a single photo. I had hundreds to go through and in the end I mostly used the Chromebook to copy photos to a back-up memory card.With regular internet access so you can log on, the offline Google apps are helpful, so if you are looking for a compact note-taking tool, etc, this is a good option. So, it's great for browsing and word processing; not great for photos or going off the grid.

2568,"It goes without saying that if you need a high-performance laptop, a CD/DVD drive, or the ability to run specialized programs on your computer, this isn't for you. If you're at all wary of cloud computing and have privacy concerns about entrusting your entire life (well, all your information at least) to Google, this also isn't for you.However, if you're looking for an ultra-portable, super fast web machine you can throw in a bag and take to the coffee shop (and not stress too much if you drop a cup of coffee on it, because it's 1/5 the cost of an ultrabook), this might be just what you're looking for. I had my reservations when purchasing, but thought what the heck it's a relatively small investment. I've had it a week now and LOVE it. The top reasons:1) Portability. This is huge for me. I have a bulky ""real"" laptop that I never use because it's too much of a bother to carry around. This chromebook fits the bill perfectly. I carry it to the coffee shop, I take it to work and use it on my lunch breaks, I take it to bed with me.2) Keyboard. The keyboard is PERFECT. The keys have just the right amount of sensitivity and I can type super fast without mistakes. The spacing between keys is generous. The ability to type and browse easily -- and the larger screen size -- makes this much more functional than my iPad which I was using before in lieu of dragging my heavy laptop everywhere.3) Security. Everything is built in and updates automatically. No need to schedule scans, worry about viruses, and purchase pricy security software on an annual basis.4) Speed. I think because this little guy's entire computing power is dedicated to the browser, it doesn't get bogged down with background applications and it doesn't get slower with age the way my laptop did after I kept adding programs and didn't know how to clean it up. The chromebook is FAST - fast to boot up, fast to open webpages. I never wait on it for anything.5) Silence. Ahhhh yes, blissful zen-inducing silence. With no fan, this thing is whisper-quiet. It also doesn't get hot. I don't miss the burnt upper-thigh syndrome and jet roar that accompanied my older, bigger laptop.Things that could be better:1) The screen. It kind of sucks. The resolution isn't super Hi-Def, and the contrast could be better (black type on white page doesn't look perfectly black, if you know what I mean). And the side-angle viewing is terrible. Definitely meant to be used by one person, not propped up in front of five. Still, I'm comparing this to Retina Display which is pretty unfair. Compared to current budget laptops or pretty much everything that existed 5 years ago, this is great.2) The body is plastic, and feels a little flimsy. It also isn't weighted properly, so you have to use two hands to open the lid (if you pull on the top lid, the bottom keyboard part isn't heavy enough to stay put by itself and let you open it one-handed).3) The audio. It's not terrible, but it's pretty quiet even on its highest setting. I use headphones and it's great, but if you want to play music for a room you'll need some external speakers.Overall, this can handle pretty much everything I need to do on a daily (or weekly, or monthly) basis. I love it so much I just bought a second one for a friend. And I anticipate this only getting better as Google continues to fine tune the OS and add more functionality through expanded apps selection. A final recommendation: don't bother splashing out on the 3G version, just get the WiFi. The 3G data is so minimal it's not worth it, and if you're an urban jungle Tarzan you're never far from WiFi. If you find yourself without WiFi, the offline capability is sufficient to let you work on documents and save changes until you get back into civilization.

2590,"I just received my Chromebook and think it's a fabulous concept and design. It works well except for one major problem which may force me to return it. It will not go into sleep mode. When not in use for a few minutes, it *appears* to go into sleep mode -- but it does not. Rather, the machine is in some kind of suspended hanging state. The power button is illuminated, but no action (tapping the touch pad, keys, even the power button) will wake it up. The same thing happens when I close the lid, which the instructions state is supposed to put it to sleep. To restart it, I have to hold down the power button for about 15 seconds to do a force-shutdown, and then push the power button again to restart the system. Also, when the computer is stuck in the not-sleep hanging suspended mode, it is draining the battery. (When in an actual sleep mode, the computer is not draining its battery.) So not only is this inconvenient and troubling, but all of the extra force-shutdowns and restarts are hard on the system and surely shortening the lifespan of the computer and its battery.I went on the Google user forum and discovered that perhaps a dozen users registered the same problem. One use had a workaround, but it's inconvenient (you can't let the computer idle into sleep; you have to sign out and shutdown each time you stop using the machine for awhile). Then I emailed a Chrome Google Ninja. I'm afraid I'll have to return this otherwise nice computer, and while I'd like to get one that works properly, I don't know how many of the ones in stock have this defect. I hope the Google folks read this, since they are generally brilliant and surely can fix this.

2606,"I have both the Samsung Series 5 550 and this new ARM based Samsung Series 3, and I love both.  The ARM one is obviously cheaper, lighter and better looking, but also has slightly lower performance.  The difference is hardly noticeable, but it's there in two places.  First, when switching tabs (when having 10 tabs open); second, when viewing video generated by the Chromebook on a Google Hangout on another computer (i.e. the outgoing video quality is not as good as with the Series 5).Other than those small differences, the two perform very similar and both are amazing devices.  The Google suite of products covers most usage of Word and Excel users, and even most basic use of Powerpoint users.  If you're into gaming or into video editing then you'll want something heavier, but for most people this $249 computer will be the one you go to most of the time.  I have it on the kitchen counter, and the whole family uses it on and off for email, homework, YouTube etc.  It's also a great computer for less computer-savvy folks (read: my sister).  I sent her one, and she loves it, and I love it because it saves me tech support phone calls!Considering this machine costs less than 1/4 of my MacBook Air, and gets most of the same things done, I think this is amazing value.

And no thanks at all to the first Samsung Customer Care Rep who was cursory and unhelpful.Another issue is the lack of Skype, about which apparently Google and Microsoft have yet to agree.  The suggested substitutes just don't cut it for me, and as one of the main purposes of buying the Chromebook was to have a lightweight computer to use when we travel, which we do a lot, not being able to Skype to family back home is a big negative for us.  Of course, I should have figured this out before initially ordering it.  The term ""Skyping""  is becoming as ubiquitous and generic as Kleenex for paper handkerchiefs -- they need to figure this out.

2621,"I was looking for a device that was portable, yet, useful. I looked into tablets, but the biggest drawbacks on all of the tablets are that they are not ""productive,"" at least in my opinion. Sure, you can get a detachable keyboard, however, they are ridiculously overpriced, bringing the total price around $600.. I am no not willing to pay that much for a secondary device.I had been eyeing Chromebooks for while, but I was hoping that Google would release one at a cheaper price. This Chromebook made that wish come true.Anyway, into the review, this Chromebook delivers as expected. I've had this for several days and I am very pleased with it. I recommend it to anyone who is willing to venture into something new. Yes, you will have to be invested in the Google applications, however, many of them are of top quality and there are plenty for you to do just about anything. I would like to point out that I absolutely love holding this Chromebook and carrying it around. The form factor is well balanced and elegant, doesn't feel its cheap (don't expect it to be like the top quality ultrabooks though).Below are what I think truly makes this device a must have:- Price- Portability- Instant boot, whether from sleep or from fresh start- Battery life ( 6 to 7 hours) on a single charge, includes watching videos and playing music- Keyboard and Trackpad (don't expect MacBook quality, but it is sufficient)- Amount of apps on Chrome Web Store- 100 GB of free space on Google Drive- Sleek design- Adequate screenI honestly cannot think of any negatives, however, below are some of the areas that need improvements:- Better optimization between Chrome Operating System and the hardware (at times, the performance can lag)- Ability to watch movies via Netflix (I know they are working on it)I know that as the time goes on, Google will be releasing updates to make the experience even smoother, so I am really looking forward to that and unlike traditional PC's (mainly Windows based), you won't have to wait long for updates.. I truly appreciate that from Google.I'd like to point out that many people are saying that Skype is not supported (the hardware, mainly the CPU, ARM processor, is fairly new, so I am sure an update will come), however, in the meantime, you can download an app from the Chrome Web Store called ""IMO."" You can use your Skype credentials to sign via IMO.Finally, it should be made clear that this device does not work like your typical PC's, where you can download any programs and such.. Many people gave this product a bad rating because it did not meet their ""expectations."" Therefore, the Chromebook is not for everyone, however, if you understand what it does and can work with it, honestly, you will not even think about using traditional PC's as much.

This machine is capable of doing more, but if you simply need something for school, like for taking notes, this is perfect.An amazing product that has great built quality for the price, and is fully functional given you have internet( I dont think this will be an issue for college students sense 99% of universities I'm sure offer free wifi).Buy this now if you simply need something for school and don't want to empty your bank account. There's no point in buying a $1000 laptop knowing it probably won't last you more then three years.**NoteYou can still access most features even if you don't have internet like typing a word doc, reading docs, etc...Though like I said before, given you're a college student you typically always have wifi whether at home, school, or a local McDonalds.

Now I have to charge it several times a day, so the battery is garbage. Yes it lasts as long as advertised when you first get it, but only after a few months it no longer keeps that kind of charge.The not holding a charge wouldn't be such an issue, except that when you plug the charger in, the mouse is essentially useless. It's sluggish and almost impossible to move with any level of accuracy. The computer also acts strangely with the charger plugged in, doing things like minimizing the window to a 2x4 inch mini in the middle of the screen with no warning or explanation. I tried to look through the help section to get answers for these problems, but got frustrated that I have to waste my time fixing a problem with their product that I did not create. If I could send it back and get a refund I would.Pros:Battery life better than a laptop even with diminished capacity, but I wonder how it will be in a year.It is super light. Having to carry around 50lbs of books all day makes it nice to have such a slim and lightweight laptop.Doesn't get hot like a regular laptop so it's easy to sit with it in your lap for a long time.

2660,"After 3 months of light use this unit became catatonic, unable to operate at all in normal mode and only in ""guest"" mode, which means you can't use bookmarks and most of the other memory-related functions. In theory this is a great machine, inexpensive, slim and light, with decent battery life, but since it can now be operated only guest mode it is effectively useless and unreliable.Aside from its addled brain, the Chromebook is hard to use; for example, there are a couple of keys missing (like delete) that makes word-processing and document production a major chore. With 2G of RAM it is noticeably slower than any computer with 4G of RAM. The screen is nice and the keyboard, aside from a couple of missing or relocated keys, is good.This would have been a great surfing and light-use machine, fantastic for travel and easily carried to meetings or to different rooms around the house--too bad it went loco. I have to rely on my tablet now, and its on-screen keyboard is totally unsuited for word-processing and document productionIf you do decide to buy one of these, be sure to pay up for an instant, no-questions-asked, immediate replacement plan.

I've had this for about 3 years now and the only thing wrong with it now is the screen will go black at certain angles if I tilt it too much, but that's because certain people I know handled it way too rough(without my knowledge) but it still works great and is easily fixable. This is definitely worth the price!

2689,"My wife and I wanted a small, lightweight notebook to take with us when we travel, and this has worked out great.  We both have Windows-based computers at home, so it took a little time, and really just a little, to get used to the Chrome OS. We wanted it just to keep in touch with friends and family by e-mail, not for anything complex, and this has been just the ticket.  We added a small wireless mouse to make navigating easier, but other than that, it has turned out to be just what we wanted.  I would certainly recommend it to others who want something for travel.  And given the price, it was a great purchase.

2691,"Update Feb 25, 2014. I (grudgingly) raised this to 3 stars. There are a few reasons where this system is actually the best system for some people. Read my Feb. 25, 2014, Update at the bottom.In the 1960s and 1970s, the government and corporations used a central mainframe computer with lots of dumb terminals hooked into it. The terminal was a monitor and keyboard, but no processing ability. They could send and receive messages from other terminals or the mainframe. Printouts were done via the mainframe. When the mainframe was down, the terminal was dead.This chrome system works much the same way. The computer must be hooked into the Internet to be functional. Printouts are done by printers which are connected to the Internet. There is only a handful of things that you can do with the Chrome Operating System if it is not hooked into the Internet.While hooked into the Internet, it can do about 80% of the things that a normal computer can do.One really down side is that most of the apps and functions revolve around around cloud storage. Google provides limited (100 GB) of storage for 2 years. After that you have to pay a rental fee. Or you can use other cloud storage systems.The Chromebook supports external hard drives, but many of the available apps don't support hard drives. Everything is geared towards putting everything that you have onto an Internet Cloud Drive.Also, not all video formats are supported. I have a bunch of AVI videos from a travel camera. I can't play any of them without uploading them to a cloud and converting them to another format while they reside on the cloud drive. However, MOV files from my DSLR play fine straight from the memory card.As I stated above, all of the power of it's apps is derived from the Internet. It is basically a paperweight when offline, with the exception of a handful of games. It's only redeeming quality is it's online ability, which is why I gave it 2 stars. I consider it a waste of money and don't intend to buy another one of these.Update Feb. 25, 2014I raised my rating for this Chromebook to 3 stars for a few reasons:  1.) It starts up extremely fast as compared to any other computer systems.  2.) The Chrome web browser seems to work better and faster on here then on either Windows or Linux.  3.) There is an advantage to using programs residing on the Internet in that they are always up to date and all related files are available to them.  4.) I can think of a few non-computer-literate people whom this computer would be perfect for. (They just wish to send/receive email, check Facebook, check the news and weather, watch some TV or movies, check to see what is on sale, and they can't seem to mess this computer up (yet). This is the perfect computer for them...)  5.) Virus protection does not seem to be a problem with this system.Please understand that any Application that requires all commands and actions to be sent over the Internet will be slower then an Application residing on your hard drive. This will really become apparent with large files like creating movies.

2694,"UPDATE 2/24/2013:After fighting through several levels of customer service hell, finally got a hilariously bad answer from Samsung.  They stated that because in my initial service request I stated that I had to use higher than expected force to seat my headphones, that I caused the damage to my Chromebook.  And my warranty was now invalidated.  They would not admit any knowledge of the port being too tight although you can google ""chromebook headphone jack"" and see that I am far from the first to report this problem.  They claimed that I must have inserted the headphones incorrectly.  Is that even possible?  She claimed that she did not know the ""velocity"" (I didn't throw it) or the ""angle"" (is there any other option than straight in?) that I inserted my headphones and that the problem was on my end.All in all, Samsung's company line was very frustrating to the point of being funny.  I informed them that I will now make it a point to NEVER buy another Samsung product, big or small, but that this problem could be rectified with just a little bit of understanding on their part.  No budging.So now I have a 3 week old, now out of warranty Chromebook.  I considered just returning it to Amazon for a new one, but now that I've removed the broken headphone jack with needle nose pliers, the computer is fine.  Oh well, for $250, what can you expect.------------------------I received my Chromebook on Tuesday.  It is clearly styled after a macbook and seems to perform very well.  I think the cloud based software that the Chromebook embodies is a paradigm shift that we'd all better get used to.  It's going to take a while to be completely comfortable with it, but I think it's the wave of the future.  Hopefully it will make our computers remain functional longer since you won't need to pack the hard drives full of data.I've had a good few days surfing around on this Chromebook.  The quick wakeup/start-up is pretty amazing.  When you open the cover, it's ready to go in less than 5 seconds.  Start-up takes less than 10 seconds.Being a Gmail/Google fan, all of the google integration was a plus for me.  But if you're not a gmail/google user, you might as well make the switch to get all the functionality out of this machine.As other reviewers have said, the keyboard is great.Well, the bad part: the headphone jack.  I plugged in my earbuds last night and noticed that the jack seemed very ""snug"".  So snug that I had to look twice to make sure I had the right jack.  When I realized I truly did, it was really surprising how hard it was to seat the headphone plug.  It went in with what, in hindsight, was a very high level of force.When I went to remove my headphones this morning, the jack held the plug so tightly that I could not remove the plug.  When I finally did get it removed, it separated the plug.  So now, my Chromebook jack is holding half my headphone plug hostage while my $120 headphones are now rendered broken and useless.I've contacted Samsung and got a service request in for a laptop that I've had in my possession for less than 48 hours.  That's just to fix/replace the headphone jack.  I had to escalate to the next level CSR to inquire about my headphones.  They're supposed to call me back in two business days on that angle.  Depending on their response, I'll decide what I want to do with this Chromebook.  If they replace/fix my headphones and somehow cure the jack issue, I think this is easily worth a 4 star review.  If they weasel out on my headphones, it will stay at 2 stars and I'll return the Chromebook to Amazon for a refund.  And then I'll commence my public crusade against Samsung's far too restrictive headphone jacks :)If you buy this, just be careful with your headphones.  Perhaps it will loosen up a little with some repeated use.  But don't use your nice headphones early on!

2705,"I've used my new Chromebook for about a month now and there are many reasons to love it- it boots up quickly, it was an inexpensive, fairly lightweight computer for light usage, I don't mind storing documents in the cloud, etc. But I will never recommend this to anyone for one large, extremely inconvenient reason: when you start your Chromebook, about 30% of the time the cursor goes AWOL. Turn it off, reboot, still no cursor. Off, reboot, no cursor again. Usually I have to wait about 30 minutes and then magically the cursor will be back. I just can't wait for the time it disappears for good! If you go on the internet and google ""restoring cursor on Samsung Chromebook"" you will find lots of people having the same problem. Samsung really needs to fix this very significant glitch. It ruins what could be an awesome piece of technology.

2770,"Well coming from carrying around a full size laptop this thing feels like A paperclip, It's super light, fast, With A Nice, Clean design. It's all powered by Google Chrome, Which is a fast simple browser. It's perfect for an older person, Student on  budget, Or just to have around the house. It's not made for extensive video editing or gaming, But its perfect for Facebook, Youtube, Emails, School work Ect Oh and the battery last forever I can stay on it for hours and hours without charging. 5*, Cant think of anything bad.

2771,"The Chromebook is great if all you want to be able to do is get on the internet. It is basically impossible to use in any professional context due to the very limited compatibility with Microsoft word. The design is slim and light but this means that everything is made out of thin, cheap plastic. If you don't have the money to buy a real laptop this can get you by for a while but don't expect anything more than a glorified web browser.

2772,"Today is Christmas and i Have been using the Samsung Google Chromebook (Wi-Fi). I have used this for the past week. I am very impressed. This is my first Computer and im 13. The keyboard is almost the same to a Mac. The track pad is very responsive and is just a hair bigger than an iPod touch screen. To me, the laptops weight is very light and portable and close in weight to an iPad 2.P.S.- I used this computer to type this review.

2773,"This product was pretty good up till the screen started to act up after year. It got to the point where it was on the comprehensible to even view anything on it because of the lines and discoloration in the screen. Very disappointing I am considering purchasing another but I'm wondering if anyone has tips as to not have that happen again. I've never dropped it I take very good care of it so it's strange that the screen would stop working after that amount of time considering I don't even travel with it. The only thing I can think is that if it was close to many times without being shut down properly but I've always done that as well so I'm hoping that Amazon customers can help me figure out how to move forward should I get another laptop like this how do not have damage to the screen.  Overall very frustrating since I take great care of everything to have something end up damaged after such a short amount of time it's been in relatively good shape for so long. Not happy with the product that from my understanding after about a year will not work properly it has plenty of positive reviews because many people are probably enjoying a laptop for what it is but a year later people see that they may have an issue if the screen does the same thing that mine did. Again open to advice on how to deal with this issue but overall not pleased with the product that doesn't have the durability to have a long-lasting screen long-term.

Awesome!It just came in today and I have been using it for a few hours and it works fine...The thing to keep in mind when buying this Chromebook is that it needs WiFi to work... otherwise its useless because it does not have an Ethernet port which I don't mind I have a router for my tablet anyway...Another thing to keep in mind is that you need a wireless printer to print (which makes sense since new computers are not compatible with older printers) to make sure your printer in compatible look for the ePrint logo on your printer...Lastly you need to use google drive for your documents, spreadsheets and PowerPoint

Well, at least Apple has experience making decent things. When I replace this thing, I'll probably either go for a Macbook or just a tablet.The only positive thing I can say is that it's lasted 2 1/2 years, but that might have more to do with me never using it than any kind of durability.

The Chromebook ONLY wants you to save things to either Google Drive or the Downloads folder. I literally cannot find a place to even see what is on the USB. Trying to save anything to it is like Mission Impossible. I don't have time for all of this aggravation.What is the purpose of this computer? ONLY GOOGLE use, nothing else. It would be great for your granny or a small child maybe, IF they never need to do anything other than use email, browse the internet, and goof off on Youtube. Hooking up a printer is a PITA, unless it is a ""cloud"" printer. I can't hook up my normal printer because there is no drive for me to install the software onto the Chromebook. I have to keep entering the password for my home wifi network, and it not so subtly refuses to let me log on unless I allow other users to access my network (wtf, google). Now, the final straw is that I cannot even save files I download to a USB so I can print them on a real computer later! What a letdown. I should have saved my money.There is only one good point: lightning fast start up speed.Basically, there are a lot of restrictions on what you can do with this Chromebook. Save your money up for something else, or get a crappy Acer that will die in about a year.

There is no CD/DVD drive (and does not work with an external one), there is no access to computer drives.  Your only storage is external USBs.  This is for internet use only.  You have access to google docs and cannot download MS Office.  It also tells you that you have 100GB of cloud storage for 2 years, then tells you this purchase does not qualify for it.  You have very limited storage on the unit itself, so stock up on USBs.  It was easy to set up cloud printing with my HP printer.  And my son was very amused by the fact there is no ""delete"" key.

2862,"I read somewhere that the new Chromebook makes a great ""second computer"" and they could not be more right.Pros:-Light-Compact-Really fast boot-Seamless integration with other Google products- 100GB free Google Drive-A really great on-screen map of keyboard shortcuts-Always updated-You don't have to worry about antivirusCons:-Won't connect with Apple products-Available apps aren't always fully vetted by Google. I've already found two popular apps that run adware as well, but nothing malicious and they can be removed easilyI actually bought this for my wife since she killed her last nice laptop and found the 17"" replacement I gave her too heavy. Her main interests are Facebook, blogging, and in general just being connected to the Internet. The Chromebook is perfect for just that! She uses it all the time, and she REALLY likes Google Drive now that she understands it. I have also fallen in love with this Chromebook, and I really like how I can use it with my own Google account whenever it's not on her lap.Probably one of my favorite and best tech purchases in a while.

2863,"The backlight went out on the LCD screen 3-4 months into owning this computer.  I sent it back to Samsung for repair since of course it was still under warranty.  About 2 weeks later, I get an email that says that there was a bit of liquid damage somewhere on the computer and my warranty is completely voided.  Of course, they did not mention whether or not the liquid damage caused the backlight to go out.  They want me to pay for repairs which I am totally OK with but they will not tell me what repairs will cost.  They want to charge me $50 in order to give me a repair quote and if I decide to not repair, I lose the $50.  This is unacceptable.  As we all know, parts cost way more when doing repair.  I have no idea what the price will come out to with repairs but it could easily be more than the $250 chromebook.  I refuse to pay this money and they refuse to tell me what it will cost to fix.  After countless phone calls with the third party repair company that Samsung uses and Samsung themselves, Samsung is unwilling to waive this fee at all.  I made it all the way up the chain at Samsung Customer Service and they are unwilling to move.  All I want to know is what it will cost to repair, that's it.  They just apologize and say it is not their policy.  But yet, they are the ones who partnered with this third party company.I refuse to purchase another Samsung product ever again.  Their customer service is crappy and they have no sense of customer loyalty.  I have had Dell out to my house (to my house!) twice to repair their computers.  If I have an issue with any apple product, I just bring it back to the genius bar and even with liquid damage and a void warranty, they will at least tell me what it will cost to fix.  Samsung won't even tell me what it will cost.  Horrible horrible customer service. Do not buy this product.

Works like a charm, nearly instant boot, easy to setup, works well with external devices - even does remote desktop connection to a PC.The only drawback I found is that you can't use Webex or Skype, which we also liberally utilize at work. Google Hangout works impeccably, though.Recommend it to anybody for a quick, on-the-go computer without aspirations for heavy-duty applications.

This Chromebook has eliminated those hassles and is now her primary PC.  It is even lighter than my MacBook Air.Being unable to Skype her brother is one limitation, but we use another old laptop for that.  He could also switch to Google Voice.Her biggest frustration was the non-backlit keyboard.  Adding a USB LED light solved that issue.As long as you can accept the limitations of a Google-centric OS, this CB provides a lot of bang for the buck.

I don't need an ipad for business, and am largely retired so I don't see the need for spending $600 for a featherweight connection to the internet.  I bought the chromebook as a 2lb alternative to my normal 15.6"" laptop.Total Frustration.  In my hotel room the wireless connected easily and functioned smoothly, though not always quickly or efficiently.But in the city itself, at various starbucks where the att-wifi is a strong and dependable connection, I found that the chromebook connected but haphazardly, and mostly not at all if I was surrounded by any reasonably sized crowd of Apple-munchkins chowing down on their feedlines.  This shouldn't happen.  A good wireless card should pull in and hold that signal regardless of how many may be crowded around and beside me.  The chromebook updates itself, so it wasn't some anachronistic cast-off.  Based on my experience, it's a toy for kids.  Or for those who live far far far away from the maddening crowd.It wasn't the crowd I found maddening.  It was the google OS:  weak bones.  No muscle.

The printer has to be a cloud printer in order to be able to print something. The Chromebook has no video for the webcam and I was not able to download or use skype, oovoo, etc. Necessary programs were not able to be installed because the programs did not support the system. This computer is only useful if you need to type something, in which you would have to use another computer to print it. Also, if you need a light weight, portable computer, then this should fit your needs. However, the fact that you need a specific printer and cannot download programs is a major inconvenience. The price for this computer is rather good and is what I would expect for a computer under $200.

This unit has HDMI out, but the functionality is extremely limited. Samsung support said that the video driver doesn't support full mirroring of the display, just playing of videos. I was able to plug it to the TV HDMI and got a great display of the desktop, but neither the cursor or any opened windows showed up on the TV.

2957,"I hesitate to write this review in light of the multitude of 5 star ratings here on Amazon, which was one of the reasons I purchased this item in the first place.  However, the Wi-Fi model was a huge disappointment.My husband, who is an IT guy by day, and myself tried repeatedly to get to the bottom of the problem, but no luck.  Pros were a beautiful piece of hardware, unbelievable picture quality, and an awesome keyboard.  Cons:  when connected to either my work or home wireless with 3-4 bars, pages would sometimes load fine but most times would spin for minutes before timing out.  We couldn't even get the Chrome OS Help to load.  When it finally loaded, we followed all of the troubleshooting tips and sometimes had luck and sometimes did not. We even contacted them directly and followed their instructions for a multitude of setting adjustments and it would be fine for awhile and then randomly would be slow to load a half an hour later.  Each time we tried turning it on and off the problem was consistently persistent.We eventually went out to a couple of online forums and found that, voila, this is a common problem, despite all the lucky Amazon owners here.  I just wish I was one of them because I hated to part with it. I wanted so badly for the inconsistency in loading pages to be worked out.  But who has time to sit and wait for pages to load when no other wireless device I own, tablets, laptops and phones, experience this problem.  Oh well, maybe the next version will work out the kinks?  ~Disappointed in New York ~

I realized that I spent most of my time on the internet on my Nexus 7 tablet and didn't really need anything more powerful or more complicated than  that so I picked a Chromebook. It works similarly to a tablet but I can comfortably type up papers on it. I enjoy the Chrome based operating system and the Google Apps like Google Docs.  I don't need much from a computer, I don't use it for music or storage.  It's basically just my little window to the internet. Love it!

Unfortunately, the laptop cover is very soft and flimsy.  It appears that when leaving the laptop closed with the cover down, basic stresses cause the screen to shatter.  The designers of the Chromebook need to re-design the cover to be much stronger and sturdier.  Total disappointment.

2986,"The Chromebook is an amazing machine in theory but the fact that most of them are unable to wake up from sleep mode is currently rendering them unpractical. Why doesn't anyone mention the fact that nearly all Chromebooks that are being put out are suffering from the ""sleep of death"" !? Everyone who is receiving Chromebooks now are getting a Chromebook that doesn't recover from sleep mode and so you have to hold the power button for 10 seconds and turn it back on. You basically can't leave the Chromebook idle because it'll go into sleep mode and not wake back up until you manually reboot it which is bad for all of the hardware and software. The same is to be said if you are to close the Chromebook while it is still powered on because this too will bring the machine into sleep mode. I just got my Chromebook and it suffers from this.I've been attempting to copy and paste the links to the issue from the Google Groups and Chrome OS Forum but they haven't been able to show up, so I've supplied the URL's in the ""reply's"" section of my review. *THESE ARE IMPORTANT AND IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING PURCHASING A CHROMEBOOK, YOU NEED TO LOOK OVER THE TWO FORUM'S!*Also - type in ""Chromebook Sleep"" in a Google search and look at all the reviews/complaints that populate!

As far as the quality of the device goes, comparing to the macbook air it is just great for $250.the shortcomings come from the limited application pool.  for anything useful like Skype or other audio/video tools you are 100% limited to the google ""hangouts"".  So if you think that this is a laptop replacement, you are very much mistaking. You cannot use your apps from the Android market.  The applications are VERY VERY limited.  again, this is not a replacement for a laptop.I got a refurb iPad3 from apple for $100 more and now i'm not limited to JUST google apps.

I'd love to be able to disable access to Settings and certain apps for my kids, plus restrict Internet access to Drive and Wikipedia for example.SECURITY ISSUEAlso, there is a big security issue on Chrome (not just Chromebooks).  If you go under Password management in settings, you can click on any of the saved passwords and simply see them without having to re-enter your password.  That means any of your kids or people who might be using your machine will be able to see your saved password.  That's CRAZY!!  At minimum they should ask for you password again.FEATURES DISAPPEARINGThe Chrome OS doesn't seem to be very stable.  Features such as going back to the previous page using a three finger swipe to the left disappeared in the latest update (which was a very handy feature).

3059,"This is by far your best option if you are looking for a Chromebook.That being said, the OS/hardward falls short. I knew going into it the basics of Chrome OS and the fact there I would no longer be using a computer the same way.What I didn't know was that even watching a simple YouTube video would be a strain for the computer. And forget about juggling multiple tabs because it is painful. The browser reloads each tab every time you switch to it.I am heavily invested in the Google ecosystem so the only thing I really missed was a CD/DVD drive. All my music and documents are on an external hard drive or in cloud so no losses there.In terms of hardware, the computer felt luxiously cheap. No problems with the weight or size at all.There were a few times the web pages would stop loading causing me to reboot to be able to do anything.All and all it makes a decent portable options, but I cannot recommend it as your main computer.

Because of the low price and size, we bought one Chromebook strictly for travel.  Within 5 minutes of arrival, it was up and going.  After fussing over it for two days, we ordered a second.  We have not picked our laptops up since the Chromebooks arrived.  The screen does not have the clarity and color of the more expensive models, but is more than sufficient.  The battery life is as advertised, if not better. It was very easy to start printing and our printer is several years old. We also love the quick start up.

Especially now that they have added Netflix support. The keyboard is great (I use it to take notes as a biology student) and the matte screen is wonderful for outdoor usage. The battery life is also a huge plus.The only real con is the touchpad. It is sometimes finicky and the front edge of the system is so thin, that if you grab it from the bottom you can actually accidentally click the touchpad. Grab it from the side or back and you won't have this issue.

3139,"The browser works reasonably well but the Chrome OS is limited.  If you are OK with the cloud and want something cheap to surf. this is OK.  You can install Ubuntu on the internal drive but the storage space is limited and it is a bit difficult to get working.  Better to install Ubuntu on a fast SD card but that is also challenging.  It is a bit easier to install Linux (Ubuntu) on a USB 2.0 flash drive, but then speed is the bottleneck.So, this Chromebook is good enough (and cheap) for surfing the web or playing around trying to get Linux to work.  It's a good way to occupy your mind and burn up spare time if you need to do that.  I paid the same amount of money a little less than four years ago for my little Dell mini 10V.  It has less RAM, is slightly slower than Chromebook running on the Chrome OS, and the display is only 10 inches but it is a real computer!

3148,"First I want to say that I really wanted to love this machine and I do love most things about it.  It's very fast, boots up quickly, surfs the internet quick, never locks up, etc.However, I have a DSLR and I love to take photos of my family and nature, I am not a professional photographer.  I mostly used web based editing so that wasn't the big issue.  I did not like not being able to edit without going online though.  The Chromebook does come with a basic image editor, and it works ok, WHEN you can get it to work.  If I attempt to put more than 5 large image files and edit them the computer slows down dramatically.  It's even worse when you are attempting to edit and save either from an external hard drive or to the cloud.  The machine just does not handle large files well, it's very slow just even showing you the preview of the images before even attempting to open or edit them.So, my husband will getting this machine because it will be perfect for him since he does not edit photos and mainly watches movies or surfs the internet and I will be getting his old machine where I can run Picasa and open/edit images easily.So if you have a DSLR and think you are going to be doing light editing on this machine, think again.  Not going to happen.

3155,"I love it, but you must be able to embrace a new paradigm.The Cloud is all the rage and that brings many advantages and DIS-advantages ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON YOUR REQUIREMENTS!And these requirements are:Surfing in the internet ... period.I have to laugh when I see my poor brother pay 1200$(!) for a Macbook so his daughter can surf in internet with an overpriced silver laptop with an apple on it.The Chromebook has the same keyboard as the mac, is silver, same touchpad, and only costs 250$!!!For another couple of dollars you can buy metallic tape and cut out an apple, put it on this chromebook and surf in internet even faster than the macbook for ~900$ less! In today's lingo you ""save"" 900$!And that's what 90% of Laptop users do with their laptops, just surf the internet.Basically this laptop is an ""internet terminal"".Everything is done in the browser; YES most things you can do in a browser BUT, the online apps still are not as good as downloadable software.e.g. Photoshop, Inkscape, etc. have online apps, ""RollApp"" being one of them.The online experience is not half as good or fast as when you simply have the software on your computer.On the other side, if you have liberated yourself from the garbage known as ""microsoft office"", and have already embraced google docs and the other excellent cloud products - then there is nothing holding you back in this laptop!It entirely depends on what you need:If you just want to surf the internet and use online apps, then THIS is the laptop of the future.Lightweight, I mean ridiculously light!HIGH battery life - Solid State harddrive! No more stupid spinning discs or fans to waste your battery.I get 6 hours out of one charge consistently.No data on the computer itself.This is the paradigm change you must get used too.Your data is in the cloud - which means in one way it is more secure, if you lose your computer , so what?The data isn't on it anyway, unless you insist on using the onboard SSD of only 16gb or an SD card/USB stick.However, if you have everything in the cloud, it is easier for the FBI, DHS or the American gov't to subpoena Google and get it. That's up to you and how much you trust our present day government, which I would say, shouldn't be much.With Moore's law still unstoppable, and SD cards of 32gb's and more I really think the argument about cloud storage or onboard storage is moot now. If you must have absolute security just augment the onboard storage with an SD card or USB stick.This computer is FAST!I don't want to surf in internet with anything else now. But not only internet is fast, it Boots up in less than 10 seconds.Switching users, Sleep, Restart, unsleep, etc. are so fast you won't believe it, there is no waiting at all.This saves massive amounts of time!And this is one of the biggest pluses I have experienced since I bought this chromebook.My productivity has shot up, just because of start and reboot times!This is a serious factor, for people, especially writers and bloggers, you will have a measurable positive effect.I really cringe when I have to use other slower systems e.g. at work etc.To sum up:This computer, imo really is the benchmark for the future.If we embrace the new paradigm of the cloud and not caring or even knowing where the data is actually stored, in return for amazingly fast performance in the internet and onboard (the OS is in the RAM only! Which enables the system speed, just like Puppy Linux) ---- OR do we cling to the old world of physically ""owning"" the data and every 2 years wasting our time on changing data mediums and transferring data and PAYING for data migration tools. Oh that brings up another rip-off - antivirus software:NOT NECESSARY IN THIS PARADIGM!Really can't believe how many people are wasting so many dollars on anti-virus software.I have been a linux user for over 10 years now, never wasted one penny on this BS known as anti-virus software, and the new Chromebooks will set you free from this rip-off, just another advantage....I predict the computer world will parallel the photography world in this change:There will always be a reason to use software that you install on your computer, like photoshop, just like there is still to this day real film cameras and real film still available. These kind of ""working computers"" are not replaceable, for industrial and professional requirements an ""internet"" or ""cloud"" computer cannot replace them.But for the main consumer, and 90% of computer usage,the new paradigm is undeniably the internet and the cloud.Write down your requirements and then buy the right tool for the right job.

3156,"I purchased this little Chromebook because my laptop crashed for it's last time.  This little thing is great for surfing the internet, and reading and writing emails.  Thought this thing would be compatible with Google apps, but it is not. After numerous calls to Samsung's support people, I found out more about what this thing won't do,than what it will do. I will probably keep this thing because I already purchase accessories for it, but if I had known what I know now, I probably would have purchase a tablet.  If you don't have a cloud printer, you have to have another computer in the house connected to the cloud to print to a wireless printer, and that computer has to be on, or this little thing won't print.  But I found it easier to sent whatever I wanted to print to the other computer by email, and print it from that machine.  This machine is cute, small, compact and portable, but all common tasks you perform with a computer either won't work, or has some kind of work around to make them work.

3163,"I read a lot of reviews and thought this would be a good purchase. I disregarded all the reviews that complained about product malfunctions and poor service because I thought, its a Samsung! I've always loved my Samsung products!Boy was I wrong.For the first two months, it was a great little machine. Performed adequately and exactly how I needed it to. It was my tertiary computer and for when I wanted to travel with something lightweight that could access the internet so I could check emails and write.Then I happened to be ill at home and actually managed to spend enough time on it that the battery was running out while I still wanted to be on it, so I plugged it in. And the mouse stopped working. Unplugged it and it worked fine. Plugged it in, the mouse was all messed up. This points to a short in the hardware somewhere, and a dangerous one at that, so I contacted Samsun support and they walked me through the troubleshooting procedures, which is fine, that's protocol, and when that didn't fix it, had me send it in to be fixed. All well and good.And then I got it back. The sheet with it said there was a software issue having to do with startup and they'd fixed it. I get to the machine and not only is it scratched all to hell, I turn it on, plug it in, and the trackpad doesn't work. Lovely. They not only failed to fix the machine, they damaged it further.I contact Samsung again, a bit mad now, but they say, sorry, sorry, we'll fix that, here's a UPS label so you don't have to pay for shipping this time, send it back in. Here's where it gets fun. I get a call a couple days later from the service center saying they can't even open the box because it was originally touched by a different service company.Now I'm frustrated. This is getting ridiculous. They've spent more time and money on servicing this cheap machine than its worth. I call Samsung and say, this is ridiculous, can't you just authorize them to work on it? But no, because I'm alleging that the first service company damaged the machine, I have to have it sent back to me, I have to take a picture of the damage to send to Samsung, then I have to send it to the first company. Which is utterly ridiculous. Why they can't just send it to the original servicers, I'm put out. I needed it to travel this next weekend, but apparently that's right out now. And when I get angry on the phone, I'm lectured about keeping things professional.At this point, when I get it back from Samsung, I'm just going to try and return it to Amazon to get my money back because this machine is just not worth all the aggravation.

3171,"A bit of background on myself: I'm a devoted and longtime Mac user, and I work at a website development company. I consider myself quite computer literate. I own a Macbook Pro but it's about 3 years old now, and the battery is getting pretty crappy so I can't bring it anywhere without needing a charge after about 1.5 hours. I could either buy a new battery for $200 or get a Chromebook for $250, I chose the latter. I'm a student as well, so having a very portable machine is important. With all that said, the Chomebook is awesome! When I'm not working (writing code, using lots of computing power) the Chromebook is perfect for all of my needs. Honestly, about 99% of people who use computers only use them for two things: internet related activities, and word processing/spreadsheets, the exact two things that the Chromebook does best. I feel that cloud based machines like this are the future of computing. There is a misconception that your abilities are severely limited by the cloud based OS, but it's really not true. This computer is shockingly lightweight and thin, while the keyboard and trackpad are more than adequate. I would recommend buying an SD card along with this, just to make sure you have some extra storage if needed. I could rave about this for days, but the bottom line is: it's a perfect second computer for those like me, and it would make a perfect first computer for just about anyone who isn't in a computer-related field of work.I'm also seriously considering dual-booting Ubuntu on this, but I'm gonna enjoy Chrome OS for a while :)

It is also built to be compact, so if you need a big screen, or a disc drive, you won't find that here.It is a great value for the price, though, and it's portability, battery life, 3G + WiFi, and out-of-the-box start up make it a good machine for a student.

3246,"My background: I am in my final year of college and have used a unibody 15"" MacBook Pro for the past 4 years. I am a bit of a tech geek and like exploring the different options out there, but certainly LOVED the premium feel and use of my MacBook Pro, however, it is no longer turning on anymore - so here I am at school without a computer.I have been using Google's 'Web Apps' for a while and I find docs/spreadsheets to do 99% of what I need. Otherwise I spend most of my time browsing, doing e-mail etc. The one thing I do use is Photoshop, which needs a more powerful machine than a small portable laptop anyway. Since I'm on a tight budget, and can't justify a MacBook Air (which really is not sufficient for much more than browsing anyway) I decided to spring for the Chromebook and get a desktop to use later on.I am very happy with my purchase, and find my experience to be similar to that of the reviews I have read. The hardware (specifically the excellent keyboard) are really 70-80% of the MacBook experience, with the track pad working very well and the keyboard being equally as good for my uses. This computer is excellent and does not disappoint at all - even when compared to the MacBook family. It is true that the screen is not as nice, but it is very usable, especially when considering the main uses of this computer (browsing, typing, reading articles).I have no problem with many tabs open and find pages to load completely satisfactorily. They do not load as smoothly as a brand new MacBook Pro - but I do not expect them to. I have not experimented with any video other than casual YouTube watching which has gone smoothly.I very rarely write reviews, but am so impressed with the value of this machine that I felt compelled to add to all of the great things people are saying.

3265,"Why did I buy a Chromebook when I already have two MacBook Air (an 11.6 and a 13 inch, both with i5 processors), an iPad, a Kindle Fire, a Samsung Galaxy Tab and a Windows XP laptop?  Well, first, I'm a technology hog.  I have a perverse need to try everything at least once. Second, my wife spilled wine on my 11.6 MacBook Air, which now has a semi-functional keyboard, so I wanted to have a really inexpensive sacrificial laptop to protect me from future accidents.  (If your spouse needs to spill wine on your laptop, I would suggest very dry wine, with a really low sugar content.)So, what's good about the Samsung Chromebook, aside from the really low price?  The keyboard is quite good.  I like it as much as that of the MacBook Air, well, at least before it had white wine dumped all over it. The next desirable attribute would be simplicity.  Open the cover, hit the on button, connect to Wifi, sign in with your Google account credentials and you are off to the races.  There's no need to buy software, keep your antiviral software up to date or backup your data.  Your data is stored in Google's cloud, where Google keeps it backed up, and this also makes your data available to you via other household computers, tablets, smart phones, and even computers you do not own like the one in the waiting room at your car dealership.  The trackpad works quite well, although up and down scrolling is opposite to that on the Mac, which is rather confusing.As others have observed, the display is adequate.What's not to like?  As a practical matter, there is no way to connect this computer to a printer.  There are work-arounds, but I don't consider them practical.  Even my iPhone and iPad provide a practical way to print: the Lantronix XPrintServer.  Need to visit a website that runs Java scripts?  Not gonna happen.  This computer does not run Java.  Before purchasing the Chromebook I understood that software choices would be quite limited.  But I assumed that Google Docs would allow me to view and make minor edits to Word files I had already created on a ""real"" computer.  What surprised me is that Google Docs cannot display certain embedded objects (such as chemical structures) in my Word files.  So, while this computer is extremely compact and light, making it attractive for travel, it may not be powerful enough for business, depending upon your line of work.So, what is the Chromebook good for?  I think it is ideally suited for someone who wants to do email and some web browsing, has very little understanding of or patience for the care and feeding of computers, and does not need to print.  In short, its great for your 87 year old mother or your 75 year old mother-in-law.  But for the rest of us, get a real computer.

3286,"On paper this thing really stands out, super fast next-gen processor, lightweight Google-oriented operating system, manufactured by a top-shelf company, etc. It's prettymuch the perfect mobile computing device for those who need a full keyboard and basic functionality without the clunkiness of windows.Software-wise it's dead-simple. Everything runs through the Chrome web browser. This is a little off-putting at first, for example I open the chromebook settings, and I'm in a tab inside the chrome browser. Wtf? So it takes a little getting used to. Also, we had a bit of an experience transferring some MS Office docs to google drive, converting them into Google Docs format, and having a little silliness ensue (spacing, etc got a little wacky). But I can honestly see the software replacing everything I did in Windows.Hardware-wise this thing is just barely adequate. The reason I say that is because there are areas that really stand out as quality, and others that made me cringe. One of the cringe-worthy items was that the bezel around the LCD screen doesn't tuck neatly into the backing. What this means is that there is a (tiny) edge that pokes out a (tiny) bit all the way around the outside edge of the screen that is a (tiny) bit loose. Like I can stick my fingernail into the seam. The other area that bugged me is the trackpad clicking action feels really cheap, I decided to tap to click instead to avoid using it.There are those of you who would critique my opinion claiming that I can't expect a $250 laptop to feel 100% premium. I'd answer that by saying it's my right as a consumer to demand unreasonable things. That's how progress is made, and it's why we aren't still using boxy slow laptops from the 90s.The highlight for me was the form factor, the LCD panel, and the keyboard. The overall shape and design of the chromebook is superb. Light, rigid, and sleek. The screen is large enough for comfortable web browsing, has decent viewing angles, and is very bright on full power. I was also impressed at the clarity and color of the screen. The keyboard as well pays homage to the high-end macbook pro series with it's black chiclet keys and comfortable key presses. It feels premium to me.I kind of wanted to give this 3/5 stars for the build quality issues mentioned above, but the software is rock solid and the screen/keyboard are great, so I bumped it up to a 4/5 rating.I'll follow up after some time if anything noteworthy happens.

3294,"I've been playing with the Samsung 303C for about a week.  I bought it with the intended purpose of replacing my Galaxy Tab 2 with a Bluetooth keyboard for taking notes and keeping up with email at work.  It will do the note taking better than the Galaxy because the keyboard is much nicer on the Samsung.  I use Evernote for the notes and Astrid for the to-do apps on the Galaxy and both of those apps are available via web based access, so that works okay. I had been hoping the Chromebook could use Android native apps but they don't.  Obviously that is my fault for not doing enough research.The biggest negative to me is the lack of corporate email access.  This is a limitation of my corporate environment but I am not able to use Citrix to log on remotely.  Our corporate folks told me the Chromebook is too niche to support.  I am also not able to use our company BYOD selected app called GOOD either.  GOOD does not offer a Chrome OS version of their app, and from what I can tell, has no plans to do so.  So for email, I am out of luck.The OS limitations aside, the machine is well built, feels right, and works as advertised.  Others have described the specs well, and I really like it.  I find myself missing the touch screen that is on my Galaxy, and have caught myself reaching towards the screen to scroll and highlight, mostly out of habit, but also because it is more efficient in some cases.  But for a little over $300 it is a rocking little web based computer.  When the rest of the world catches up, and when they add touchscreen and Android app capability, this will be a truly awesome machine. For someone going to school or not in need of corporate connections, it is a very affordable and worthwhile unit.

They just time out after a couple minutes of trying. However sometimes it will work if I unplug the computer if it is plugged in or plug it in if it is unplugged. It's not my wifi that's the problem, every other computer and phone loads just fine at the same time.Because of that last reason, I feel the computer is terrible since I can't even use the internet half of the time.

It looked as if pixels just died.  We sent it to Samsung assuming it would be under warranty.  Samsung said our warranty was void due to physical damage to the screen.  WHAT??  There was no outside damage to the screen.  We have pictures to prove the pristine condition of the laptop.  There's not a scratch, dent, scuff, NOTHING wrong to the outside of the laptop.  It just quit working correctly!! I can assure you as I was in the room the entire time that this chrome book was not dropped, not sat on (as they said could happen), etc.  NOTHING happened.  It just worked and then it didn't!! They said there was an internal crack to the LCD, but they couldn't tell me how it happened.  They couldn't put me in contact with any technician, supervisor, etc to explain to me how an internal crack can occur despite no trauma to the unit!! They said the third party company they send these to for repairs deemed ours physically damaged and the warranty was void.  Samsung said there was no further action to take except to pay them a $50 evaluation fee and the cost of repairs!!  After doing research, I have found that our scenario is not uncommon.  Google ""spontaneously cracked screen Samsung chrome book.""  Apparently Samsung is aware of this problem and denies any fault to their product!  I have never been so disappointed in a company's product and customer service as I am today with Samsung!!

            "
3332,"The device I think it's great, maybe according to specifications is not the world's fastest computer, and that made ​​me fear a bit about performance, but I confess that it has exceeded my expectations, very comfortable keyboard, the screen size is ideal for everyday tasks, device is pretty light.To test processor speed I was playing Angry Birds and only at the beginning of the game I seem to notice some lag, but the rest of the game was pretty good, offline version did not vary much in game speed but obviously improved the speed of initial load and between each stage.The internet connection is pretty simple and familiar, detects wifi networks available, put the password and go. What surprised me here was that I plugged my Galaxy Nexus via USB, enabled USB tethering and it worked perfectly, without additional configuration or anything. Simply spectacular... but, it works once, next time doesn't work, I don't know why, maybe is a problem with my smartphone's Internet provider, last weeks it doesn't work very well.Device has also options to configure VPN access, but I failed to connect, maybe I get it later and post the tips.Specifications not mention it, but on settings menu there are options for bluetooth devices. I did a search on two smartphones, and Chromebook was not discovered, neither smartphones on Chromebook, so it is only a menu for supporting devices.Applications menu seems simple and precise settings tab is the same way as Chrome browser, with some additional options like Wifi settings, mouse and keyboard, etc..I must confess that the keyboard looks weird without the function keys, but once you use it you realize that you do not need it. The size and spacing of the keys is pretty comfortable. It has a support for keyboard shortcuts (pressing Ctrl + Alt + /), which seem to be very large, but all of them have a utility that amazes, even you can increase or decrease the brightness of the keyboard, if the device supports it. Although the keyboard is in English you can configure to write with accents, ""ñ"" and symbols of other languages. Perhaps worst of the equipment are the keys themselves, at first glance seem to be a cheap plastic, the space key when typing sounds somewhat, unlike the other keys, but are soft to press and doesn't have annoying click like other keyboards.The touchpad is simple, has no buttons but allows simple gestures (special moves with two fingers), which make it quite easy to navigate. The drawback I found is that the touchpad itself is a bit harsh, maybe it's my skin but sometimes at dragging fingers the mouse gives some small jumps on the screen, is not serious but could be better. My wireless mouse was recognized and it worked fine except that I could not set higher speed, the maximum offering is not what I would like, but can be a problem with my mouse, should be tested with other models, but is a matter of taste.The built-in webcam offers good quality, but unfortunately on a G+ hangout I noticed that ChromeOS is not supported on some options, such as masks and others. It's disappointing, I found a group on Google Groups where a Google engineer acknowledges the problem and says they are looking for a solution, but the answer is dated 2011, I hope to settle it soon.The built-in speaker sound is great, being located under the machine, in the front, makes the sound heard from everywhere on device, which is fine with me. In fact when I'm writing I am listening blues from my music collection in Google Music and is very nice.For a hangout I could also see that headphone's jack does not accept the microphone built into the headset from my Galaxy Nexus, which I think is strange because the picture on the Chromebook indicates that accepts headphones and microphone.Chromebook lights in just 8 seconds (yes, 8, timed), and pressing the menu option to shut down you do not realize and faded (3 seconds off). When off and lift the lid the system turns on automatically, avoid pressing the power button, which I think is a very good idea, as well as opening the applications you had open when turning off. It takes a few seconds (no more than 5) to reconnect and continue with what you were.When connecting a flash drive it recognizes and displays the files in a small embedded file manager, which also shows a local folder called ""Downloads"" and Google Drive. It strikes me that when connecting my Galaxy Nexus is not recognized and does not show me the files, however when I connect my LG P500 recognizes the 3 partitions I have (normal internal, second partition for Link2SD and SD card). I think maybe they thought the Galaxy Nexus, being a Google product does not need connect to Chromebook and you can get on the web photos and files directly with native applications (auto uploads), perhaps someone don't like it, but I find some logic and does not bother me.The battery is fine so far, charge is quick (2.5 hours to charge) and takes about 6.5 hours as promised.The only thing someone might miss is to have the option to burn CDs / DVDs, but in my case that's no problem, since I have a PC with Linux I can do that.Regarding the use of the same equipment as simple as a web browser, with all standard options that are expected of a modern browser and we know in Chrome.Being Chromebook based entirely on web applications I saw the need to look what applications might need as ""executable"", and so far I have been able to supply all I can think, ChromeOS's help give you several alternatives to common tasks via web. Even I was surprised to find a terminal emulator (telnet, ssh) via Web, which works perfectly.Incredible is the successful integration of hardware and software included, and the ecosystem of ""applications"" that has been created and also integrate well, almost without access to the small inner disc, although some seem 16Gb easily reach the conclusion that you do not need much more, considering that everything is designed for use via the web with a few options to work offline (gmail, docs, some games, etc).In conclusion I think if you are a student, reporter, photographer or any profession that does not need to use Windows applications or business, or just love surfing the web is a great device, with everything you need , and a great price.At least I'm happy with the purchase and I recommend it

I knwo its not the signal itself, because I have a work laptop and a smartphone that work anywhere else in the condo (as well as outside the condo).  I have literaly sat 30 feet away from the wireless router and surfed the internet just fine on my work laptop and the chromebook doesnt even picj up the connection.Even when the conection does work, it lasts maybe 5-10 minutes and then resets.

3354,"This computer is not meant to be a desktop replacement. It is not for everyone, either, as Google's ad states. However, it is a computer that can be utilized by many people. I'll talk about the following aspects of the computer in this review: 1. Keyboard 2. Trackpad 3. Screen 4. Performance 5. What can people use it for in general? 6. Price, build quality and wrap-up1. The keyboard on this computer is absolutely marvelous. As you may have guessed, I'm using it to type this review. The keys are spaced very evenly, and there is a reassuring *click* that makes old mechanical keyboards look like dinosaurs. One minor detail many people will notice: there seems to be no Caps Lock here. It has been replaced by a search key. However, Google is quick to tell us that we can still access the key by pressing Alt-Search. Also, no number pad, but computers of this size can't really have them due to space constraints.2. I will always keep my mouse handy because I'm not much of a trackpad person. However, that's not to say that I'm going to do you readers a disservice and not review an important aspect of the Chromebook. This trackpad parallels the one on my dad's MacBook Air. In case that's not clear, it is the best trackpad you will get at this price point (more on that later). Suffice it to say that using it is a fluid experience that will leave all but the pickiest among us satisfied.3. This is a 1366 x 768 matte screen. What does this mean for consumers? Let's just say it's not the best screen out there. For that, one must look no further than an iPad 4 or a Nexus 10 (both are more expensive). Once again, it's a matte screen (for more on that, look up matte vs. glossy screens on Google, Yahoo, or Bing). No dead pixels so far, videos are fine, but remember that this is a relatively small screen, so it may well be hard on your eyes. I myself am 18 years old and have decent vision, but some who will consider this should be aware that it is imperative to try to go to a local Best Buy and use it for several minutes. Rest assured, however, that the display on this computer is great for what it's supposed to be.4. This may well be the most important section for some of us, myself included. This computer has what's called an ARM processor. It is one of the most powerful ARM processors currently available for consumers. These processors mean no fans, no noise, but possibly worsened performance. Let's look at all three of those points: it is true that there are no fans or hard drives or other moving parts of any kind in this device, and it really doesn't make any noise. As for actual performance, with just 2 GB of RAM advertised, and probably less actually available for the user, try not to open more than roughly eight to ten tabs at once. I'll be more specific: if YouTube is running, music will be choppy almost all the time if anything, and I mean anything, is loading. If Google can fix this through one of their every-six-weeks software updates, then great, but if not, know that this is what you get at such a low price point. Oh, and by the way, as for games, your mileage may vary. What I mean is that you can go ahead and try to play your favorite browser-based games, but some games will run slowly, while others will run smoothly. If you wanna play chess on the Chromebook, be my guest; I doubt it'll lag.5. Also an important section, obviously. Chromebooks are not for everyone, as I noted before. Let's review what you can and can't do here first: you CAN create documents, slideshows, spreadsheets, and even forms that can be posted online for others to fill out (awesome feature by the way, try Google Forms, even if you don't have a Chromebook). You CAN have a calendar here with appointments and all that jazz (Google Calendar), and you CAN have reminders as well. You CAN do many things even when there is no Internet connection: documents, slideshows, spreadsheets, music, MOVIES (not YouTube videos), games that support offline play, among other things. I think it's adequate to say that Chromebooks have come a long way in terms of being able to use them offline. Moving along, you CAN'T play any games that are not in the browser (examples are World of Warcraft, Guild Wars 2, etc). You CAN'T use Skype, Facetime, Photoshop, or any program that has no browser mode. Off the top of my head, some more prominent examples of this include writing code for computer programs, but if that's what you do, then you probably already knew that.6. It only costs $249 plus applicable taxes. I think that this is great. Half the price of the iPad but it can do everything that the iPad can, and it has a larger screen and a keyboard to boot (it is a laptop, after all). Also, let's not forget that this device looks almost like a MacBook Air. It's thin, light, and sleek (boy, are those words overused). It looks great in my eyes. Sure, the iPad has a much, much, sharper screen, but it's more expensive. This is the perfect workhorse/plaything/do-it-all-except-non-browser-stuff device. I'd say buy it, but before you do, do what I did: try to justify it to yourself. Don't say, ""Do I want/need this device?"" Instead, say, ""Will I use this device for enough things to justify buying it?"" The price point is low enough that many of you could do no wrong in buying the Chromebook, so go out and get one if it'll be useful to you.

As it has all of the same apps, and similar operating system. Not much of a gadget queen but I have a fire, a second generation droid, and now this chromebook. I'm not unhappy with my purchase.Cons: HORRIBLE speakers! (I mean my phone has better speakers), it also crashes more often than any other computer I've used. For the money I'm not really complaining but if the speakers were better and didn't rattle or sound like someone took a sledge hammer to them--I would be much happier. Last but not least, I really wanted this chromebook to do case noting on. Unfortunately, all my case notes are password protected--google doesn't do that. Supposedly they are working on it, but as of now I can't do that and it really really sucks.

3386,"Samsung's hardware is impressive, but the Chrome OS isn't quite ready for prime time.  Every time I go to a new tab, the screen refreshes, which is time consuming and also sometimes erases text that I had just entered on the browser window.  I use the two-step Gmail sign-in, and every time I power down the machine, it makes me reenter the new six-digit code, another time waster.While it makes the Google features such as Gmail, Google Drive, and YouTube easy to access, it isn't nearly as easy to use as a Windows OS, as it lacks many of the keys and the Windows functionality.  I find myself constantly frustrated with the poor WiFi connectivity and the slow performance.  I added in an SD memory card, but the system does not use it to boost the working memory.  It treats it mostly as a memory transfer mechanism, much like a USB memory stick.If you travel by air frequently, the free 12 Gogo passes might make it worth the cost.  Otherwise, I'd recommend buying a cheap Windows PC or a Nexus tablet.  This device tries to be both, and fails miserably.

3388,"I just got my chromebook today, i read all the good words about chromebooks but I have to say you should not expect a whole lot from a ""laptop"" using a ""smart phone"" processor.For the good part,it's very light and portable, you will love to carry it around and type something. The keyboard is very good in my opinion, better than most of the real laptops at $500 pricing point and up. I heart a lot of good things about the track pad in this model, but I think it's just fine. I and using a macbook, so maybe I am spoiled by their track pads. The screen is about acceptable for me. I had an old dell inspiron 14z, and their display are on par.Now comes the concerns you may have. You can get productive with this product, but don't expect to rely on this little machine for real tasks (that was what I expected, and turned out to be wrong). The biggest problem for me is that this it will have problem processing large files. I am currently doing a research and working on a spreadsheet with 2000 items. The whole machine becomes  laggy when I open up this file. If you are just typing your paper, you may end up just fine. Beside, you will get laggy experience when you open up multiple tabs.All the complains I have is about the speed. I don't think it's snappy as it should be. I would blame the processor for this, those models with intel processors may work flawlessly.

This chromebook is plastic and keyboard is not ideal for typing.  However, I'll give this device 4 star since I still like it.Pro: battery life, light, I love the ChromeOS approach, comes with a rudimentary ssh terminal to access my ssh servers.Con:  Google Print, not many offline apps, and keyboard is quality is questionable.  I'm also concerned about the paint/finish of the computer.  Likely will wear out and scratch easy.As for Amazon, I wish I could give them a rating.  I requested a second replacement computer since the first one delivered had a nick in the case.  The second one was delivered quickly and in good faith.  Unfortunately,  the second one had a bad keyboard.  I noticed that it was difficult to type since the keys were not uniform.  Some required light touch and others required harder press.  This made it difficult to type quickly.I decided to keep the computer with the cosmetic defect (and better keyboard).  I wish Amazon sold ""new"" items.  I may call their customer support tomorrow.  This isn't the first time I got a ""used"" item sold as ""new"".If you have a difficult keyboard to use, consider a replacement from Amazon and cross your fingers.

3393,"I bought this Chromebook six months ago for home use surfing the net, watching videos, sending emails, etc.  I have an HP laptop for work, so my goal was finding something that was lightweight, would start up quickly, and had a long battery life.  The Chromebook generally does all of those things, and if it worked consistently, it would be a great low-cost computer for what it was designed to do.The big problem is that it crashes and restarts frequently.  Usually at least once or twice over the course of a 15-minute browsing session.  It doesn't seem to matter what I'm doing or how many tabs are open-- video is a frequent culprit, but it also happens when I'm scrolling on a page, loading a new one, or even if I'm just looking at a static page.  This weekend it crashed 5 times in a 5-minute span, and while it restarts quickly and preserves nearly all the information upon reboot (including draft emails or half-completed forms), it's very frustrating to be interrupted so frequently.I returned the first one I bought hoping it was just an issue with that particular machine, but the next one I got does the same thing.  I've had it for 6 months, and had hoped that Google/Samsung would push out an update that would address this issue, but stability continues to be an issue.  Eventually this will likely be a nice product, but for now, there are definitely better options out there.

3422,"I was really excited to receive this in the mail.  I knew exactly what to expect from it, and what it can/cannot do.  It was set up to be our perfect couch machine.  Then it arrived.  Within a few hours' usage, the period key fell off every time I used it.  I couldn't get it to remain in place so I contacted Samsung support.  They couldn't mail a new key, it seems- they had me ship the entire machine to their New Jersey repair facility.  This was already a tremendous disappointment, but I returned everything to its box and drove it over to the UPS facility less than 48 hours after receiving it.  It arrived in NJ a few days later.  Today, I received a call from the facility.  There was a fault with the power supply (on this brand-new machine?) which was replaced free of charge. . . but the keyboard issue was considered ""physical damage"" and I would have to bear the cost of that repair.Since the repair facility is a 3rd party, I called Samsung directly, because this had to be mistake.  How is it reasonable that a brand-new machine, not abused in any way, would be subject to a paid repair in this kind of timeframe?  Despite their policies, I was sure they'd be willing to make this right once I explained how ridiculous it was.  Apparently not.  The representative escalated my call to ""executive service"", who reiterated their policy to me, and explained that there would be no accommodation.  I could choose to pay for the repair myself, or have the machine sent back to me without the repair.  She was more than happy to ""fully document"" my complaint but was unwilling to budge on the repair or ""speculate"" on what I could have done to cause it, or whether their response was reasonable given the circumstances.  Policy is policy.So keep in mind, my brand-new machine already had a repairable flaw out of the box, and developed a second one within hours of normal usage.  If anything is amiss with either your keyboard or screen when you receive yours, you'll receive similar treatment- after paying for a new (broken) item, be prepared to be hit for repairs, as well.  I will never buy another Samsung product after this experience.  As soon as the Chromebook comes back from New Jersey, it's going right back to Amazon.

Do you want to be able to surf the web (with wifi or an ethernet/usb adapter only!), check and send emails, and... and... nothing else?  Then this is the netbook for you.Good at what it does, but what it does is very little.  For mom and pop that just want to use the web, it's great.  Lightweight, decent battery life, and best of all inexpensive.  However, the Chrome OS is a freakin' TRAINWRECK of epic proportions, and Google's own apps such as Drive, Sheets, etc... they all function very poorly, slowly, and sometimes not at all.  I ended-up ditching mine for a Microsoft Surface Pro, but don't let that sway you if all you want is the ability to use the Internet: the Surface Pro is like $1300 after tax and is a full laptop/computer that happens to also be a tablet.  The Chromebook isn't the same thing, it's apples to oranges.  I got the Surface Pro because I bought the Chromebook for consulting sessions and I feel the Chromebook isn't up to snuff for professional applications.  If only Google's own apps worked properly and reliably, and were actually compatible with Office documents (as Google claims... most of the time you lose a lot of formatting opening Office documents in Google apps).  For personal, Internet-based use, it's golden.Oh, and if you don't have an Internet connection... it can't really do ANYTHING.  Seriously.  The offline versions of Google's apps are even worse than the online versions, and it seems that the development team has spent as much time as possible making it very, very difficult to even find and activate the offline modes for most Google apps.Lastly, the Google Store is terrible for Chromebook apps.  BEAR IN MIND: You CANNOT use Android apps on this.  It does not run Android.  An Android fanboy I work with (who is very savvy, usually) assumed it would have access to all the apps in the Android store and it does NOT.  There is a separate set of apps for Chrome OS and they're all terrible.  99% of them are just hyperlinks disguised as apps that take you to flash-based web apps.  Worthless.

3453,"This chromebook is nice, lightweight and compact. I enjoyed it for the few months that it worked. Unfortunately, within 5 months of purchase the screen started acting up. At first it was a few lines covering part of the screen and then within a couple days over half the screen had lines or was black.  I called the Samsung support and they told me because it was still under warranty I could send it in to be repaired and the only cost to me would be the cost of postage.  After spending $20 to send it, I was informed 2 weeks later that the warranty has been voided because of the ""cracked"" screen.  I called and tried to explain that I did not drop nor damage the chromebook in any way; however, Samsung refused to fix the issue for me. Waste of money and time! I will NEVER purchase a Samsung product again!

3460,"I have an iPad 2 and was contemplating replacing it with a netbook. I found myself borrowing my fiancee's laptop more often so I could use a mouse and keyboard. My budget was small (roughly what I could get if I sold the iPad) and this seemed like a good fit. Once I got it out of the box and up and running (which was very easy!) I was just a little underwhelmed. It is definitely inexpensive, but there's no avoiding it with the product in your hands. It's quick enough and boots quickly. The screen is decently bright but the color is not great. Same with the speakers - loud enough, but a little irritating for watching a movie or playing music. The keyboard was a surprisingly good fit with my hands (I'm a 6 foot tall male, if that helps) so typing was reasonably comfortable considering how small it really is.Ultimately though, I sent it back. I like the form factor, but there were just too many little flaws for me to be completely satisfied. For what it costs, I think it's still a good deal. It would be a great first computer for a student, maybe a gift for someone who just needs to browse the web and send email, but it just wasn't quite enough for me.

For a few basic functions (Gmail, Google Drive, Facebook, Youtube, Dropbox) it's extremely fast and convenient. I use my laptop for gaming and running GIMP and stuff, but do most of my social computing on the Chromebook now. It isn't as powerful or easy to customize as a real laptop, but as long as you use it for what it does best (social media), it's great. Excellent battery life, too.

3475,"My Chromebook has essentially replaced my MacBook Pro. Keep in mind I usually use laptops while sitting on the couch. The Chromebook is so much lighter and the MacBook just seems like an unnecessarily large, heavy piece of metal that's unpleasantly cold initially, then uncomfortably hot when it's been on for awhile. The Chromebook, of course, has no fan and does not heat up. But it isn't cold to the touch since it's made of plastic. I barely feel the Chromebook since it's so light, and it's easy to reposition and pick up with one hand. The keyboard is indeed nice, the screen is nice and bright and fine quality. The speakers don't don't hold a candle to the MacBook, so I would recommend using earphones if you desire high audio quality. I did trip over the power cord twice while the Chromebook was plugged in. On both occasions the power cord remained plugged into the Chromebook. I guess I'm used to Macs since they use those magnetic power cords that release very easily. So the first time, the Chromebook was closed and launched off of the coffee table. The power cord prong that sticks into the Chromebook bent a little but it still works fine. The second time, the Chromebook was also pulled off of the coffee table but it was open. It landed upside down and the top edge of the screen case popped open somewhat. Luckily, I was able to snap it closed again, and it's good as new. Since there's no hard drive, the Chromebook just kept running as if nothing happened. When my MacBook fell from the couch once, it rebooted because the hard drive got too much of a jolt.

3500,"I'm a professional writer working on my twelfth novel.  The dream of a second computer as portable as a pad of paper was just too tempting, and I ordered the Samsung Chromebook after Christmas.  Demand is high.  There was a brief delay in delivery.  But the Chromebook arrived on a Thursday, and as promised, it proved to be a very eager machine.The set up was simple and quick.  Google had me synched and flying in minutes.  The screen seemed dim, but I expected that from the reviews.  The keyboard had a good feel.  The touch pad was better than most.  (There wasn't a lot of cursing time.)  But my wireless mouse was slow and sloppy.  So I bought a bluetooth mouse and found the same problem, which meant another trip to the store to get my money back.  A little wired mouse proved good enough, and over the weekend I began settling into my new life as a roving, coffee-infused author.I've been working more and more with Google Docs.  My old laptop has no major problems handling novel-length files, and while there are quirks and kinks with Docs, I love the idea of backing up my ideas while avoiding Microsoft Word.  But the Chromebook wasn't thrilled with files of 80 and 90 thousand words.  Loading was slow.  Navigation was very slow.  Also bothersome was how the cursor didn't quite line up with the words, always hanging a little below.  And worse, that sweet keyboard let me type quickly--too quickly, since the text on the screen was always a couple seconds behind.This wasn't going to end the experiment, but I was seeing troubles with my data.Reviewers love to talk about the ""ecosystems"" of various tech giant.  I like some of Google's options.  Google Play, for instance.  But when it comes to apps, and with movies that can be bought...well, Google doesn't have an ecosystem so much as a weed patch.Again, none of this was causing me soul-searing grief.  It was just bothersome.But then on Sunday night--again, my Chromebook arrived on Thursday--the touch pad quit working.  The tiny plug-in mouse still functioned, but not the touch pad.  I turned off the Chromebook and rebooted.  I did that twice.  (The machine is wonderfully quick, coming back from the dead.)  But the pad remained comatose.  A quick googling for help, and I instantly learned that I wasn't the only customer who had discovered this tendency.I decided to return the machine, printing out the Amazon labels while I started hunting for a replacement.  I ordered one of the last ultrabooks running with Windows 7.  More money by a lot, but that's a short term expense.  $249 dollars is a lot of cash if the toy breaks in four days, or even in a year and four days.Obviously these problems will be solved someday, what with updated software and design changes.  But my book is due in April, and I can't wait.A final note:  The next morning, I turned on the Chromebook to wipe it back to its factory settings.  And the touch pad was working again.Google is a mysterious deity.

3541,"The touchpad rarely worked.  All of Google's prescribed remedies didn't solve the problem, so this Chromebook is going back for an exchange.  I will update this review when I receive the replacement.UPDATE P.M. 6/18/13:  Replacement Chromebook received.  The touchpad works this time, POORLY.  Horizontal pointer movement is fairly smooth, but the vertical movement is erratic, akin to the pointer getting stuck on wads of gum.  The pointer suddenly jerks up or down as it breaks free from one 'wad of gum' and gets stuck on the next one that's in the way.  This problem renders the touchpad to be imprecise and practically unusable.  This second Chromebook is going back for a refund.Aside from this glaring problem, I really like this product, but I am forced to conclude that too much build quality has been sacrificed in order to make this device available at a low price.  The Samsung Chromebook is shoddily constructed and I do not recommend it at all.UPDATE P.M. 6/20/13:  Thanks to a review comment I saw at Amazon last night, I found out that the problem with the touchpad is due to the AC cord being plugged in.  Unplug the cord, and the touchpad works perfectly.This afternoon, an Chrome update took place and now the touchpad works perfectly whether it's plugged in or not.  The Chromebook looks like a keeper for the moment.UPDATE 8/29/13: Two months of daily use and no major issues to report.  It has been kept in the same spot on my desk and never picked up or transported elsewhere.  The most I've done physically is open and close it, so my review is not informative as far as how well it holds up to being carried around.  There were, however, two spontaneous reboots.  They both happened while casually surfing.  Suddenly, the whole thing goes dark, the startup screen would appear, Chrome comes back, and then all my browser tabs returned to their previous addresses as if nothing happened.  Weird.UPDATE 3/2/17:  Samsung Chromebook is now dead after 3-1/2 years of desktop usage.  All I get are blank screens of either black or white.  Google's chromebook recovery procedure using an external drive is a failure.  I tried using both an SD card and a USB flash drive, but the result was the same:  ""An unexpected error has occurred...

3542,"I love this. Very light, easy to use and fast. It does all I need it to do. I have a MacBook Pro which I use mainly for work but I just need cloud computing so this is more than adequate for that. I won't be using my macbook much more now with this - so much faster. Ultra portable, very fast and love the chrome products. Highly recommended for what this can do.
            "
3543,"I bought this for my teen, who is constantly carrying it around, so it's been durable. Battery life is pretty great. She's had no problems and it is in constant use. She watches Amazon Prime shows on it, reads books, surfs the net, answers emails, and updates her status. She has all the tools she needs and with this light weight laptop, she's able to use it anywhere in the house or on the move. Highly recommended.

3544,"This device could easily be considered a tablet with a laptop like structure. The device is very efficient for word processing and anything else that could be considered a lightweight task, this keyboard is easily one of the more comfortable that I've come across and awfully reminiscent of a Mac Keyboard. This was a perfect birthday present to myself. Almost every other review on here has covered anything positive I have to say, the webcam could be better but I have other devices for video chatting.
            "
3545,"The only reason why I did not give it five stars is because it does not support netflix, major disappointment for me, and it also cannot play dvd's. I have done without video entertainment since this was a good computer at a decent price.

3546,"I'm extremely disappointed with this item. I purchased this chromebook, I'm not very technology savvy so I was sure to read the reviews. I came across the review of a tech worker who claimed to have purchased this device for his parents...he loved it so much he stated he bought one for himself as well.With that being said, I bought the device it arrived. I got someone to set it up for me.Within the first two weeks of having the device the screen begin to flicker and dim, when when on power cord.I'm a extremely busy person and didn't contact Samsung within the 15 day replacement time , and I was 3 days beyond Amazon's replacement time frame.I'm very angry and dissatisfied because my point iswhat properly designed, and configured brand new device straight from the box would need replacing within 2 weeks time with less then 10 hours use?For me this was a horrible choice

3558,"There are a few bugs that need to be worked out on it, but overall it suits my simple needs as an internet portal. What bothers me is that it sometimes slows way down when it opens pages. I sometimes feel like I'm using wireless dial-up. It also has  a weird glitch.  If you leave the screen open for too long, it just ""falls asleep."" The only way to reset it is by holding the power button down for 13 seconds. It will force the computer to shut down, then you can restart it. On the positive, it's nice and light and might last until your 1 year warranty runs out.UPDATE! The stupid thing broke a few months after the warranty ran out, had it less than a year and a half. It will cost $100 to fix it. Samsung is a real jerk of a company to deal with. There are so many other options out there don't risk buying this.

3566,"It's my own fault for not reading more in detail/not understanding, but this is not a laptop replacement by any means. I am planning on getting a tablet for my clinical years of study and was looking for a cheap option to replace my laptop that has gone downhill.  I also wanted something small, and they sadly don't make netbooks anymore (I loved my HP mini a lot).It cannot run Microsoft Word, Itunes, anything not in the Chrome Apps.  Google Docs is fine for me (provided I can figure out how to save as a .doc), but not having Itunes is an issue as podcasts are how my lectures in school are recorded.Also, it is continually saying HTML Webworker has crashed... and that's obnoxious so I need to figure out how to get rid of that but the articles I found were not useful.
            "
3567,"I liked how the ?? looked and how many ports it had.  The keypad needs some work, like making the letters show up.  And the electric plug-in could be a better connection.We travel a lot and wanted something that we could play audio books, show movies and play games on and yes check our e-mail.  Since we travel a lot we aren't where we have internet all the time.  This makes the Chromebook worthless.  You can't add any apps if they aren't made by Google for Chromebook, just try working off line or even getting off line with out the system shutting down.  When I was reading the reviews it didn't say anything about these kind of problems.
            "
3568,"This is a nice laptop and works just fine.  It did not have the options for plugging in a larger monitor or a printer and I write a lot of letters and needed to print them.  I hated to send it back, but it did not accomplish what I needed.

3576,"The review of many products is misguided and off base because of a lack of understanding as to what the review should be.  If your buying an SUV you want to know how well the car performs carrying, cargo and maybe off road functions; you do not care about zero to sixty times or the like.  Its a classic mistake.  Same for the Samsung Chromebook.  I bought one and love it...because it does what I expected and needed.  I do not care that its not good at large files, or spreadsheets, or playing movies or games.  I wanted a light weight, simple, easy to use, device that would let me search web news sites, look up information, and read email.  And do it all with no complex BS.  The Chromebook does all those things and very well.  If you want a machine that is just a delight to use for simple things, this is it.  Get one and enjoy.  Oh, and please don't review it as if it was a $2,000 PC.  This thing is simply wonderful for the simple needs and us simple people.

Less cluttery compare to other OS.I say ""nice! What a great deal for 280$ !!!""""How about we tested it on offline?""..So I turned off the wifi. Then BOOM! There's our major drawback:Without internet connection. It's worthless piece of flippin' metals.Can't do word, can't access docs, etc etc..I checked the offline apps and their not as many as apple app has. some are even useless...I say 95% of it's function depends on internet. BASICALLY it's a Cloud book!Glad I did check it before giving it as a gift. It'd be useless for a student who live in places with limited access to internet.

3593,"Overall, I like this product, but the power cord and internal power jack are of very low quality. I have gone through three power cords, only to have the jack itself come loose. I am not particularly rough with the laptop or cord, either. It appears that anything more than minor twisting of the jack while plugged in can easily damage both the jack and the cord. And be warned, buying a genuine Samsung replacement cord is very expensive. At this point, I am not likely to replace this product until this issue is addressed, which is a shame because I otherwise liked it.

3594,"Amazon shipped this quickly and it was packaged well.  After plugging it in, it started right up and was very quick and intuitive to use.  Once it was connected to the wireless network, the internet was just a click away.  Start-up time is amazing.  Connecting to the internet and search results are both quick.  The display is excellent (not too big but not too small).  Good size for portability.  Haven't really used it for word processing or videos, but that isn't what it was purchased for.  It was purchased to have a quick, portable device to work on the internet effectively and this certainly fulfills the need.

I wasn't too worried about it falling apart, because, hey, in 2 years it would probably be obsolete anyhow. My reasoning was wrong. It is extremely flimsy. The keyboard started falling apart within 3 months, but the Chromebook was still functional. But in the past 2 weeks, the screen has started to fade out into a pinkish color. Without the screen, it is useless. So, ultimately, I paid $250 for 6 months of substandard computing. Think about that before purchasing ... are you willing to trash it after 6 months?

3666,"I got this thing, opened it, turned it on and went to set it up following the prompts. Well, the cursor wouldn't move, or moved sporadically. I looked online to make sure that the Google Chrome system didn't require that I use 2 fingers or something. I eventually called the Samsung help line. ABSOLUTELY NO HELP!!! VERY RUDE!!! Their answer was to restart the computer, which I had done twice already. Then, they told me to do a system restore...lol. I responded by saying, ""No thanks, I won't do repairs on a computer that I just took out of the box."" She responded by saying, ""I'm sorry, we have concluded all of the troubleshooting that is available. Good luck.""So, I returned it immediately. I've seen positive and negative reveiws for this thing. If you get a good one, maybe it'll perform very well. So, roll the dice, because if you get a defective one, good luck, as my customer service rep said.

3679,"I received the backordered $329 Chromebook with 3G today.  A sticker on the box says, ""Included with this device for two years is up to 100MB per month of Mobile Broadband service provided by Verizon Wireless.""  I turned on the computer and quickly hooked up to my wi-fi and opened a google account.  Looks like a good little laptop, but no clue in directions or online how to access the mobile broadband.  I suspected that a card to stick in the back was left out of the package. I called samsung support.  They did not seem to know about the mobile feature at all, first suggesting I call verizon and open an account.  They took my info and I faxed them what they needed including a picture of the sticker on the box.  This is a new product. They promised to get back to me.

3680,"I must admit that I'm a bit disappointed with this computer. While it can certainly surf the web and run web apps, and google integration was seamless, Chromebooks are not acceptable laptop replacements. There are many simple things that I am accustomed to doing on a laptop that chromebooks do very poorly or not at all. I don't want to have to use a web app or their clunky file manager to organize, crop, or edit my photos. I'm not even a photographer and I was annoyed with what it took to process a few pictures (just regular jpegs, not RAW images or anything fancy).The processor certainly leaves something to be had. Granted, you can't expect blazing fast technology for this dirt cheap, but you would think that the stripped down chromebooks without a complicated OS to juggle would be able to perform the same as a regular laptop. In this you WILL be disappointed.That said, it is compact and can do most of the things that you would do online everyday (especially if social networking and web surfing are your only activities). If you already have a desktop, laptop, smartphone, etc, this can offer a very portable way to access the web on the go. However, I think of it more as a tablet replacement than a laptop replacement. Don't ask too much.

3700,"I know this is a budget device. ""What do you expect for a $250 laptop?"" Well I expect it to function as described. I don't know if its the software or the hardware in this case, but this whole platform is devastatingly far from ready for the average consumer.My biggest complaint is the screen, I havent seen an LCD this terrible since around 2001-2002. It has the kind of viewing angle that if you are looking at one part of the screen you cant see another. Colors are washed out and contrast is poor in even the most optimum of environments.Flash implementation is insufficient for doing even certain things on Googles own services. Play a Twitch video and a Youtube video and you are likely to crash. Give a single stream enough time and it will crash.Google Docs, I have a pretty heavy duty spreadsheet that I use for work. This system could not pull it up in any sort of usable way. Not even close.My advice, spend a little extra money and get a full featured budget laptop or pick up a used Surface RT.

3756,"I have started using my Chromebook 3G both on wi-fi and on 3G. Under a separate comment to the post ""Do not order this product"", I have described how to set up 3G. I wished an instruction sheet how to do that were included with the laptop and/or Amazon Chat and Tech Support had that information and were able to help.First impressionsLaptop is very light and thin. After starting it, it is amazingly quiet: after all, no fan, no spinning HD, no noise of any kind. I really like it.The Chrome updated itself automatically after finding and connecting without any problems to my wi-fi. When starting it, one needs to select a ""user"". So far I am using Guest account. Browsing Internet comes without any problems. Some (better designed?) pages load as mobile versions.I have inserted 1GB (only) SD card from my Kodak camera and of course I can browse easily its content. Saving to it a document from the web was a snap.Chromebook 3G has wi-fi, 3G and Bluetooth. Keyboard is very nice, screen is sharp, nothing to complain about. There is a video camera, a microphone, and two small speakers: sound is OK. I wished it came preloaded with Skype for Chrome (if there is one like that) but under Google store there are several programs for video chat. However, I would like to see a Skype version for Chrome. It appears that one must set up an account on Google first to download any app.Must learn what can and what cannot be done with this laptop. For example, can I print on my network wi-fi printer?So, far, very pleasant impressions. I wished the manual had more information. However, there is an extensive manual on the web.This is surely a new way of using laptops: on the cloud printing, on the web data and storage, etc.So far, I am very pleased with it.Second impressionsI am more and more impressed with Chromebook 3G. I have learned how to switch from wi-fi to 3G (after I got 3G set up).  In fact, this new comment I type connected via 3G -- it is at least as fast as my wi-fi. I see no difference even with 2 strength bars shown for 3G.Since I am using my laptop as Guest, apparently I can't switch from wi-fi to 3G while logged in as such: When I go to the Settings page and try to enable ""Mobile data"" (under which there is Verizon wireless) I get a message something like ""Only the owner can change that."" However, the following works:1. On the Settings page disable wi-fi. It will say ""not connected"".2. Reboot the laptop.3. A page will appear asking you to select either a wireless network or a mobile data.4. Select ""mobile data"" and click on ""Enable mobile data"".5. Assuming you have already set up your 3G prepaid 2 year service which came with this 3G laptop, ""Verizon wireless"" will appear and laptop will connect to 3G.Perhaps the above steps will also work when the 3G service has not been yet enabled: it would make sense if it did by allowing one to set it up then.So, far I am enjoying this new way of working on a laptop.PS1 The above method also works when switching back from 3G to wi-fi. I hope that switching can be done while logged in as the ""Owner"" without rebooting (needed apparently when logged in as ""Guest"").PS2 I have discovered that when Chrome is connected to the Internet via 3G and I disable ""Mobile data"" on the Settings page, it automatically reconnects to my last-used wi-fi network! Neat!

3757,"I did my research-hours of reviews and videos-and decided a chromebook would be a great computer for me.  I'm a full time seminary student and use my 17"" PC laptop primarily for taking notes, watching videos, playing music, etc.  All of which can be done on a Chromebook.  So-I bought one.  Within 24 hours I had clicked the return button to send it back to amazon.  What's great on paper and in theory is not so great in practice.  The computer is constructed well for a cheap computer-but you are getting what you paid for.  In the end it's still an 11"" computer that can ONLY do things through google Chrome.  I use Chrome every day-I'm writing this review in it now-but to have to do everything in it just wasn't for me.  You can purchase a cheap laptop with MUCH more power and capabilities for a very similar price.Before I used a Chromebook I thought they were great.  After I used one I realized they are nothing special.  It's exactly what it says-an 11"" computer that only functions through the Chrome browser.  If you cannot do it through Chrome, you cannot do it.  Period.  Also-the screen quality is not great and everything about it feels pretty cheap because, well, it is.If you constantly travel and need an 11"" laptop for that-you could consider this.  However, I would recommend you look at a similarly priced Windows PC that can do so much more than this is capable of.

I loved using it- fast, light, capable of doing most everything I need it to (surf web, listen to pandora, write and edit documents, etc,). I ended up returning it though because I have a work computer and a personal computer at home... Will certainly consider this machine when it's time to purchase another computer.

3776,"I bought this laptop for a friend who is not computer savvy. This friend only needs a computer for email, facebook and Skype. For such basic usage, I figured a Chromebook (which is meant to be a laptop that only runs a browser basically) would be perfect.Since I am my friend's tech support, I usually setup everything with all installations and accounts beforehand to make life easier.What I had failed to realize until after actually using this Chromebook, is that it does not support skype. I find this to be totally ridiculous! Since skype is supported on Android devices and available on the app store. Instead, the only option you seem to have is to use ""Hangouts"" Video chat. Which, yes works...but this means forcing all of the family who have accounts on Skype to get onto this other video chat system. Obviously Skype is more popular and used.The other problem is having a gmail account. If you happen to not have a gmail account, or do not like to be logged into this account at all times while using the Chromebook, then guess what? most of the feature of the Chromebook become disabled. Things like saving bookmarks, access to apps like Youtube is not available until you sign in (really? why do I need to be logged in to use YouTube????). You will also be unable to download and install new apps.Needless to say, had I known about the Skype issue before hand, I would not have purchased the Chromebook. since it was one of the main features I was looking to use this for. If you do not need it and only want to use it for internet browsing, then I suppose it would suffice.

3794,"For four days the Chromebook was everything I wanted. I took it out everyday. Never had a problem getting connected. Had no trouble using Microsofts's web based Word. I told myself I'd save better than $700 by not buying a Macbook Air. Then Friday at my favorite coffee shop, the screen dimmed. I noticed that the battery was close to 10%. I took it home to charge it completely. The next day I still had a too dark screen. My Chromebook is now on its way to Texas. I'm hoping I'll have better success when it returns. If so, I'll give it 5 stars. If not, I'll reduce it to 1 star and buy that Macbook.Update: After owning the Chromebook for less than six months, it has stopped working again. Samsung's over-the-phone support thinks it has been corrupted when I was on MacDonald's wireless network a couple days ago. And for $99 they will fix it, without me having to ship it back. But this is the second major problem in less than six months. I can't see spending $100 on a computer than cost $250 to start with. The Macbook Air is looking better and better.

No way to install print drivers. So I searched the web for answers as far as printing. Apparently you have to have another computer that's connected to a printer and wifi, and then eprint to that computer. This ruined the whole ""replace my dead macbook for a few months"" purpose of buying the chromebook. It doesn't interact with peripherals - usb dvd drive, printers, ipod etc... Also despite the fact that there is a video camera, you can't record without being connected to wifi. Basically it's a tablet with a keyboard, that doesn't do much without a wifi connection. I wasn't looking for macbook power for $249, but being able to print a word doc or email to a usb printer is a fairly simple task. And the ability to record video to a flash drive/SD card shouldn't be too much to ask when most smart phones can do it. Most likely will be returning...

3908,"Purchased the Chromebook for my daughter and when I tried registering the product on Samsung's website, I noticed that the product did not have a serial number attached on the unit. Opened a ticket with Samsung and emailed Amazon receipt for proof of purchase. When the screen started to show signs of going out (only after three months of use), I shipped the unit to Texas for Samsung to fix. Upon arrival, Samsung took a photo of the bottom of the unit where the serial number should be and voided the warranty due to no serial number on the unit. Now, unit is en route back to me without it being fixed.Kudos to Amazon for taking the product as a return and offering a full refund. As for Samsung, you lost me as a customer.

3918,"I am a long time Mac user and find the Chromebook and the Chrome OS very usable. Here are my initial thoughts after a couple days...* The screen is a little cheap.* The whole design kinda rips of a MacBook Air, but uses a plastic enclosure instead of metal.* It's easy to type on, but the keys feel a little cheap.* It is very light weight.* The OS is very usable, especially if you use a lot of Google web services.* They give you 100 GB of cloud space for buying the Chromebook.* The trackpad is surprisingly good for being so inexpensive.* OS upgrades are painless.* Battery life is decent and sort of accurate at ~6 hours on one charge.* It uses a proprietary charger.* Overall a very simple and clean OS that works well with Google web services.* It has a shell that you can open and SSH to servers.* There is a remote desktop client, but I haven't used it yet.In all, it feels like an inexpensive laptop that is a cheap knock off of the MacBook Air that costs $250. The Chrome OS and the 100 GB of cloud space make this a very good deal. It is a truly disposable computer that is great for web work and web browsing. You're not going to be able to run Windows or Mac apps, but you can use Google Drive and the plethora of Google services without issue. Hope this helps.

3933,"I bought this Samsung Chromebook for my wife's birthday. She was using her phone to browse the internet, and I thought the bigger screen would appeal to her. Initially, it did. It was fast and easy to use, but shortly into use, she got a ""blink"" crash. For no apparent reason, the laptop would suddenly restart while browsing. My wife reviewed some user groups and found it would happen when the profile became corrupted. I set up a new profile and again, it seemed to work well. Then the blinks started to happen again. Several times an hour.We started to use the laptop less and less until our home computer died. We hoped to use the laptop for browsing and research on a new computer. One week into that, more extensive use, I left the laptop to charge, but it failed to turn on when I opened it. I plugged it in and found the battery level to be at 1%. I used it while plugged in and it blinked again!! I stopped my session then and there, but left it plugged in to charge. When I returned a few hours later, the battery level was still at 1% and there was a clicking sound. The next time I tried it, still no charge, but it would turn on at all.If I were to gauge my use in hours, I would say I got two weeks out of this piece of garbage. i suppose it speaks volumes that Amazon will only stand by the product for 30 days.Please avoid my issues and BUY A REAL COMPUTER INSTEAD, not this disposable paperweight.

Then problems began to happen. The cause of the problems seems to be a failure of the USB 2.0 connection, as well as a software issue related to the copy-paste function of the Chromebook file manager. Also, it appears to be possible for someone using the chromebook to expand the size of an application window so far that he can't close the window. Or anyway not easily.In the end, the Chromebook just didn't work out. I was not satisfied with it at all.An earlier version of this review was probably more about the Kindle and the Kobo e-book readers than about the Samsung Chromebook, so I've edited it to remove the information that should be put into different reviews.

4006,"I've been living with my Chromebook (CB) for a few days and without going as deep as some here, here's some bullet points:Amazing form factor - almost identical to an 11 inch Macbook Air but personally I prefer the feel of the plastic - I feel similarly about my Samsung Galaxy S3 over an iPhone too.So light and small compared to my HP DM4 or really anything but a tablet.Instant start up into Chrome OS is a convenience that now makes jumping on my W7 laptop a frustrating experience.Keyboard is phenomenal. At my desk I use a full size Logitech keyboard but I find going the the CB keyboard very natural.Trackpad is up there with the best in the business.Screen - decent - its no retina display but does the job and I like the matte finish.Build quality - really good. Yes there's a little give if you push hard enough on the shell and keyboard but quality is way beyond what you would expect for the price.Chrome OS. - I am deeply embedded in Google Apps for email / calendar / contacts / web browsing and do about 90% of my work in the Chrome browser so I am loving the simplicity of the Chrome OS and CB.MS Office etc - I do a lot of work in Powerpoint and some image and layout work with Adobe CS. Unfortunately at the moment the CB is not going to replace my Windows laptop at my desk but I can use Chrome Apps and Office Online apps in a pinch for some of that work if I need to on the road.Chrome Apps - I suggest spend some time checking out the Chrome App Store. There is everything from enterprise to productivity software and a ton of entertainment and games.Music - subscribe to RDIO or Rhapsody and with a wifi connection your music needs are covered.Kids - I set up my kids Google Accts and am happy to hand it over and let them log in without having to worry about any of my files / settings etc. In fact I'm probably going to buy them each one for the holidays.As a second computer for traveling or running out to meetings this is a no brainer for $250. Also great for using on roadtrips for the kids to watch movies or play games - just load up an SD card or USB stick with media.My hope is that the cheap price and Google Apps for Education means that more schools get computers in the hands of more pupils. Definitely a game changer.

The speakers are loud, the trackpad is big and functional, the battery lasts forever, it's quick and sleek/thin.Unfortunately, you're also stuck with the software.I absolutely hated using chrome as my operating system. It's great for browsing the internet, but that's all. Shockwave was constantly crashing when I tried to watch online content, much of which was just unavailable from the start.Google drive is completely worthless at this point, even though it's probably the future. Regardless of your connection, it is literally going to take DAYS for you to copy 10+ gigabytes of information. I couldn't get any external storage device to connect to my USB or SD slot. When they would pop up, I still couldn't view their content....the window just froze. Torrents were a massive hassle, apps are limited in both number and function and most of all, you can't use Google earth!!! Yes, you read that correctly...Google earth is completely unavailable on the Google chrome operating system. It really just feels like an incomplete OS.Chrome is absolutely horrible. I only needed this laptop for web browsing, light picture editing, small torrents, viewing/editing contents on external hard drive and using google earth...web browsing is the only need that's sufficiently met.

They explained me that when you buy the product directly from a non recognized third party (in this case amazon) the warranty doesn't apply to the third buyer (in this case, it would be me). It seem that the product warranty description that comes with the product it's not for the third buyer, it's for the directly buyer or the person who purchased directly from the owner of the trademark.

So we shipped it for $12 and then started getting calls that it was not covered by warranty and that it would cost $170 to repair. So $182(with shipping cost) for a $200 computer to be repaired? No thank you. We will find a better computer with a better warranty or better customer service. And I don't blame the woman who told us how much it would be, she was just doing her job, but I expected more for something that was not caused by us.

4081,"A laptop from Google? Oh boy, if you only knew how fast I got in line for this bad boy. At a wonderful $329 price-tag and built-in 3G, this is a student's dream. Or so I thought...Sadly this bare-bones operating system is woefully underdeveloped. I understand Google's willingness to cut out the middleman (Microsoft) and sell cheap netbooks, but restricting the ability for users to install even the most essential of programs is a fatal flaw. For instance, the internet of today wouldn't be what it is without Java. This quiet little platform is only visible as an icon in the system tray. Most computer users can only recall the nuisance of the pop-up updater as their only interaction with the program. It's surprising to some when they find out just how deeply embedded Java is in today's internet and devices. In fact, Java has become so integral to today's technology that even I was surprised at how handicapped I was without it.Now let me be honest and tell you what a fantastic time I had with this thing. It's lightweight, portable, and has internet access anywhere! (maybe there's a dead spot somewhere out there but I didn't find one, Verizon is pretty great as far as coverage is concerned. Now I'm a little worried about the 100 MB cap per month (most webpages are at least 1 MB to load), but I hardly ever found myself without wi-fi so I probably used under 10 MB's. The display is crisp and clear, keyboard amazing, and it has a very slick look.So why only 3 stars? Why did I return it? It was a pretty difficult decision, let me tell ya..... But ultimately the lack of support for Blackboard, the national-standard learning platform for online higher education, is what killed the deal for me. Maybe after a few more releases they'll have it all figured out, but for now I'll just shell out a little more $$$ and wait for my hp envy x2 to get here :)tl;dr This is the best second computer out there to get on a budget. The simplest Remote Desktop ever is built-in so it's manageable if you need to access a program to just remotely run it with ease. But if you're looking for your first device you may be surprised how many features you're missing out on a few months later. The Chrome web store just isn't yet up to par with having alternate solutions but I trust in Google's ability to fix this one day.Thanks for reading!

Loads quickly.  Light weight, less headaches to transport. Battery lasts 7.5 hours.  Allows multiple users.  (Less capabilities than an iMac or perhaps other laptops.)  Yet, user friendly.

This little charmer has had nothing but heartburn trying to connect to the net. I finally dragged into work to get on our guest wireless to make sure it worked. I'm slowly but surely working on getting it to function better but it is like learning PCs all over again, in some instances.Not going to give up. One big help will be getting it to ignore all the other networks at home, other than the main Xfinity signal. I can see the potential of this thing but using our IPads was far more intuitive and a much smoother process.Caveat Emptor

However as those issues seem to have been fixed by the manufacture it would be crude to list something that has been addressed properly, except to say that it is nice that a company fixes issues with their products. The issues we had were never directly addressed by the manufacture. I mean to say we were never contacted about any thing, not even the post I had up here. Or the complaint I sent it, however they did fix the problems so I don't really care about that.Pros:Nice robust loud speakers.Light weight.Great Battery life.Incredible Start up speed.Cons:The only negative I had for this device has been addressed.

4107,"I guess I was pretty impressed with this product the first time I saw it. I am a principal at a elementary school, and I purchased this to see what it was like, with a mind towards using it with a 1-to-1 initiative next year. My 8th grade son is very computer-literate, so I gave it to him to try out and report about. On the positive side, it seemed to work well while it worked, and he was able to produce pretty good materials with it. He enjoyed using it.However, several months after he received it, it failed. Specifically, overnight it developed a crack from one corner to another, under the glass, that rendered the device worthless. I looked for signs that it was dropped, abused, or something else, even though I didn't see it at home. There were none. To top it off, he had been storing it in the box it came in, for safety, and overnight, it was rendered worthless.No problem, I thought, I will just return it to Amazon. But they will not accept it, due to the several months having passed. OK, I thought, Samsung will do something. Not so. Any damage to the pixels under the screen is not under warranty, and will cost more than the device to repair. So I am out of luck here.When I google ""Samsung Chromebook cracked screen"" I get a whole bevy of hits, mostly inexplicable. When I spoke to an IT person who did computer repair, he just shrugged, but said he had seen/heard of the same problem.So, what did I resolve from this experience?1) Discourage everyone I know from purchasing a Samsung Chromebook due to structural unsoundness, unless it comes with an iron-clad replacement warranty. Even then, the time and effort to get a response from Samsung has pretty much soured me from purchasing anything they make ever again.2) Encourage people not to order this type of equipment from Amazon, since they state in their policy that your only recourse is talking to the manufacturer, and that failed in this case. Newegg or CDW, here I come!3) Keep my eyes open for the inevitable class-action lawsuit against Samsung, where I will end up getting a $13 gift certificate towards a future purchase of their materials, if I am lucky. :)4) Encourage anyone who is skeptical of my claims to look it up on Google before they purchase this product.5) Write my first review of anything on Amazon to inform those who might want to purchase it, to encourage just such a process.In a sense, the experiment worked. I have certainly gotten feedback on our expected purchase of Samsung Chromebooks for our school. So I am not ungrateful. Just a teeny bit ticked to see my son look so excited, and then so deflated, about a product, and for him to learn that, at least in this case, Samsung and Amazon don't seem to care about the quality of the product they sell.

The text and images are barely legible, and the entire screen has a deep red hue.  So, I called up Samsung, expecting them to roll out the red carpet for me given the age of the unit and the fact that it's clearly a manufacturing defect...  boy was I mistaken.  Yes I got an apology, from the service representative who assisted me, but beyond that, Samsung isn't exactly going out of their way to keep this customer.  It will take ~10 business days to get the computer repaired or replaced (coincidentally, about the amount of time It's been in use). But they aren't going to replace it with a new computer??  Nope.  They will either repair mine (heck knows what else will happen to it), or they will send me a REFURBISHED unit..  i.e. someone else's computer which will likely have scratches on the body. an abused trackpad, worn usb ports, etc.  Not very impressive Samsung.  You know if it were an Apple computer, I would have a NEW computer in my hands the very next day.Oh, and Samsung...  Please feel free to reach out to me to discuss.

4122,"This laptop is very light so be gentle with it. It seems very easy to break because of how light it is. The keys are very soft and I love it. The webcam is very clear and fun to play around with. This laptop revolves around Google and ONLY Google. Hence the Google Chrome browser that comes with it. That's one thing I dislike about it, not being able to download anything other than Google. I'm a gamer and this laptop isn't suitable for games due to not having the right file type but other than that, it is perfect for traveling. I also got confused about downloading apps when I first opened it. The instructions and help papers that comes with it does not explain very well either. It's mostly in Chinese. So when you first open the laptop, it will turn on but logging as a Guest blocks you from downloading anything. Make sure you log in as a user. The shipping was super fast also!I gave it four stars due to not being able to download anything other than Google. BUT I am very happy with this purchase (it was purchased for my younger brother) but again, I love it.

Works great with googles suit of online apps.3. Looks Nice4. Lots of free Apps5. Boots fast.Cons:1. Buggy? (Crashed right out of the box when I tried to use the camera app. After updating the OS it started but crashed. After Reboot..it has not crashed.)2. Cheap Feeling, Looks nice but feels cheap. I predict port covers failing.3. Power Adapter looks like a failure waiting to happen. Long and slim, lots of leverage for breaking off the connector on the motherboard. Education Customers will go through a lot of these if using for one-to-one.4. Sluggish. Boots Fast..but many apps feel very sluggish. Even Angry Birds.While cheap was a pro, I believe you get what you pay for.I don't know what market this belongs in?I hoped that it would be good in a school environment. Its complexity and inconstancy, and bugginess would frustrate any non-technology savvy teacher. I think its durability would be truly in question. Probably about the same as netbooks. Perhaps a little worse because they have valued thinness and have used materials that don't seem up to the job. We'll see.Before you buy one, if you want to really feel the user experience, install chrome on a 6 year old computer and only use Chrome...nothing else...except for the boot time, it will feel about the same.If my view changes after a long term test I will update this review.

My Chromebook arrived very quickly and had a great price. It was packaged efficiently and seemd quite pristine.  Sadly though, within 2 minutes of set up, the right side of the screen began to flicker, loose all resolution and become color-striped, then I lost that half of the screen to complete whiteness.

I am just told to contact my internet provider who tells me to reboot my router and modem.  That didn't help either.  Right now I am out the money spent and cannot use the thing.  I emailed the problem and got an answer back to check the icon on the bottom of the screen to see if internet access is turned on.  How can I do that if I can't get past the setup screen?  There are no icons yet.Update.  I got my new Chrombook today and it was doing the same thing as the first one.  I called 1-800-samsung and got a different consultant.  Turns out the problem is the way the mouse works.  I feel pretty stupid, but from reading the other reviews I find I'm not alone.  The booklet that comes with the netbook doesn't tell you that to left click, you push the mouse down with one finger and to right click, you push the mouse down with 2 fingers.  I was using the mouse to move the curser and pressing the enter key, thinking I was doing a left click.  I am now setup so I can give it to my son for Christmas.  Don't have enought experience to give it a higher review, but I am raising it from a one to a three because it works, but the instructions need work.  Not everyone who buys it knows how to use the mouse so instructions in the booklet and when speaking to a consultant should be more detailed.

4141,"Do you really need to spend $1,000 on a MacBook Air (and yes, I have one)? If you don't define yourself by a brand, then I think the answer is, maybe not.The differences? While the Chromebook may be plastic vs aluminum, the keyboard is very similar. I'm not a display snob so I find the Chromebook's screen fine. To use an automotive analogy, the Chromebook screen is more Nissan than Mercedes in quality, but it is incredibly functional. We use computers for email, research, bill pay and homework. All of those tasks can be done on the Chromebook very easily. Each person can have their own cloud account and personalized the experience simply by logging in. Writing and data entry is quite easy with the great keyboard. You can't do that on a tablet unless you buy a separate keyboard. You may find installed programs that reside on your MacBook Air that haven't yet been replicated on the web, but there aren't many.If you have tons of stuff on your hard drive, you'll have to train yourself that the hard-drive is now in the cloud. But heck, many of us have used Dropbox for years. I also have 4 back-up storage drives that I've used every time we moved stuff from one computer to the next. Now some of those are failing. The cloud solves storage more elegantly and effectively than an external hard drive.For email, I recently redirected our custom family email domain to Google, and find the Gmail interface with our custom email address quite fantastic.Another issue folks may face is music management. While Apple dominated that market for years, the cloud has changed the concept of music storage and play. Stream it on your phone or you computer from the cloud and get the music off your desktop. With Amazon Cloud Player and Google Play you can free yourself from the other expensive music options.I'm not bashing Apple, and working at a online software company I used them as an example of great design. I've also owned 8 Apple computers over the past 10 years. Yet, with the Chromebook you get a get a great cloud experience and can save the $800-1000 dollars. That will be a big  market driver for a generation who find money somewhat tighter than in the past. It also seems like the perfect new category of computer for businesses that have employees doing sales, customer support, and order management.I'm impressed. The Chromebook is light, more functional than a tablet, less expensive than a laptop and easy to use. It's a Cloud-Powered ""Laplet"" (Laptop / Tablet).Update:After 5 months of constant use/abuse its running great. Still totally pleased.

Something is obviously wrong with the machine, and it is just plain unreasonable to expect an end user to repeatedly rebuild an operating system.This is really sad because I am looking to retire my HP netbook before it becomes too slow to be of use, and the Chromebooks appeared to fit my need perfectly, even with the absence of Skype.

I would have thought that this product would not have launched with such a critical unresolved problem. I also am discovering that Google does not have any traditional form of customer service outlets. All I was able to do was fill in an online form to a customer service ""ninja"", but as of yet I have not received a response.

4203,"I ordered the Chromebook because my laptop crashed and I needed something to replace it for school. I don't have very much money but all I needed was something to write essays, do research and submit online assignments with.-Touch pad is erratic and unreliableThe first issue was that the touch pad is extremely sensitive. When I place one finger on the pad and stay as perfectly still as possible, the pointer jumps around in about a 3-inch area surrounding where I am trying to direct it. Sometimes it works better than others. But at times it has taken me up to 3 minutes to click on something, even after rebooting and troubleshooting the Chromebook. This makes it very difficult to get work done.Some other drawbacks are that...-Netflix is not supported-You can only play video games supported by Google chrome-Google knows EVERYTHING you do-The integrated webcam sucks & most other webcams can't be used with the chromebook because google chrome doesn't support their software.-I have yet to find an alarm clock that will wake the system up from sleep-Microsoft word isn't supportedPerhaps my touch pad is defective. If this is the case then I'd recommend using Chromebook only as a second ""computer"".  I will say it's good at booting up quickly and surfing the web just as fast. It's a cool idea but it's not working for me. I recommend a tablet w/ attachable keyboard over this. You can find them for about the same price. I wish I'd done that.Update: Luckily, Amazon Prime Warehouse has great customer service and a good return policy. I returned my presumably defective Chromebook for a full refund. They even paid return shipping. If you think yours might be defective, just return it and mark it as defective.

4213,"Purchased for a friend, the immediate short comings: 1) No Skype, 2) terrible Google telephony, 3) Static IP WiFi addresses prohibited, 4) Counter intuitive for Windows user, 5) Chromebook supplied without manual.Later disappointments: WiFi failed in middle of use after less than 90 days.  3 hours of live chat support and erroneous support web sites lead to bricking of system.  Were sent to a support web site that did not work, subsequent one hour chat straightened that out.  Unable to save anything (settings, downloads) for system.  Planning to send the brick back to ""service"" for a minimum 11 business days not including shipping.After a few hours the Chromebook booted (?) still with the old system loaded.  Found recovery with USB stick instructions for download at google-chromeos website.  Did that, only taking another hour or so and now the Chromebook is ""operating"" ""normally"" - except all downloaded files are gone.In fairness, Samsung Live Chat operators seemed eager to fix the problem, but were not up to the task.Advice: (a) if you have a Chromebook, buy and keep a 4GB USB stick.  Download the recovery software for your system and install it on the USB stick.  If there's a failure and no other computer available, you can use it.  If another computer is available, update the USB stick and use it. (b) Anything you ""download"" to keep, save on Google Drive,  temporary or intermediate stuff can be saved on ""downloads"", and will be lost on recovery. (c) the wireless device in the Chromebook is pretty wimpy and susceptible to interference, distance that don't phase real WiFi hardware, so stay away from other WiFi systems, away from noise generators such as florescent lamps, etc. (d) The purchase of a USB-Ethernet dongle might be a good idea.  (e) Get used to thinking the ""google-way"", it'll save you time and suffering.The Chromebook-ChromeOS has some nice things, but you can only use them if it's working.UPDATE: This August back to Samsung for repairs.  Has only the very minimal (meaning once in a great while) WiFi connectivity.UPDATE: Returned after just a few weeks, now wireless at least works most of the time, but strangely ""forgets"" wireless security passkey at home.  Probably due to Roku 3 wireless new to home, will move Roku 3 to wired LAN. Happy with Samsung turnaround but not so much with the results.

4222,"Think about it for a moment, does a person need more than a browser (and tools for software development if that is your job)?  What more does a person need in life than browsing and software development?  My browsing is mainly to get ideas or sample code or solve specific problems by looking up error messages or get library call references.  Is email as important as that?  Probably mostly a needless distraction but it can be done adequately in a browser.Do we really need budgeting software?  Overkill. Keep some numbers in a text file or online or (like me) don't bother.  Word processing?  I use probably 1/2 dozen menu (sorry ribbon) choices in Word and the rest just get in the way.  Spreadsheets? Do it online or if you are doing serious data processing, write some code.  Likewise for image processing, do it at an online site or write your own which is very easy with libraries available for most programming languages.The first thing we need to do with this machine is switch to developer mode (google for that).  Second we need to run programs.  First realize that the way this system is designed, it will run whatever programs are installed and no more.  So first remount the home filesystem to execute programs in it:ionsudo mount -o exec,remount /homeWe can easily install software by remounting other filesystems as read/write and using normal installers.  But I don't want to do that because I am trying to keep as close as possible to one design philosophy of the machine which is don't muck around in / or /usr or similar locations.Having remounted /home you can now run any software you want.  But one catch is that the libraries for most packages would normally be in /lib.  So be prepared to set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH in your .bashrc  Next we need to find software that will run on this OS and processor.  Specifically we need ""armhf""  I like to use the debian distribution and find the packages and the dependencies myself.  To do that I locate the package I want in [...] by clicking through the hierarchy (first I switch to the testing distribution - wheezy).  The package is in a .deb format file so I do this on a mac. Using ruby as an example, I find that it needs libc6, so I click to this page:Download Page for libc6_2.13-38_armhf.deb on ARM Hard Float machinesand download the file.  Next extract the contents:ar x libc6_2.13-38_armhf.debgzcat data.tar.gz | tar xf -This creates a usr directory in my home directory.  I do that for about 8 or 10 more dependencies plus the program itself (in this case ruby).  Ruby is probably about average complexity in terms of library usage.  This is more tedious than apt-get or similar programs, but AFAIK those do not work without writing into the system directories.Once all the files have been extracted for ruby and emacs (all I want), we set our LD_LIBRARY_PATH in .bashrc.  Note that I put ruby and emacs in separate directories in my home directory, but that is not necessary.export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=""/home/chronos/user/ruby/usr/lib""export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=""${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/home/chronos/user/ruby/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/gconv/""export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=""${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/home/chronos/user/emacs/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf""export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=""${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/home/chronos/user/emacs/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf""Tell Ruby where its libraries are tell emacs where the lisp is:export RUBYLIB=""/home/chronos/user/ruby/usr/lib/ruby/1.9.1""export EMACSLOADPATH=""~/emacs/usr/share/emacs/23.4/lisp/emacs-lisp/""Finally make aliases to run ruby and emacs (or make symlinks and modify PATH instead):alias ruby='~/ruby/usr/bin/ruby1.9.1'alias emacs='~/emacs/usr/bin/emacs23-nox'Now comes an important caveat with this computer/OS.  The browser eats all the important control keys, so we can't edit using emacs without downloading the terminal shell.  So go to the Chrome store and get some software:[...]I downloaded and installed ""crosh window"" and ""secure shell"".  What I ended up with is a separate window that I run chrome's shell in, which does not eat control or other meta keys but sends all key strokes to the application inside the window.And that's it, you now have a development station with good screen resolution and GIANT control and alt keys in the lower left corner.  There simply is not a better key layout than that.  The keys are chiclet and a little clacky.  The case is plastic, but the form factor is great - very thin and light.  Battery life is great although sleep eats battery more than than my mac.  The computer is silent, the USB slots are on the back, the sd card sticks out the side.  I would rather have it all sticking out the back because then I can put the computer in a small case and let the cards and sticks stick out the top.The only downside that I have run into is a slight pause every now and then.  It seems that stops everything, shell prompts, keystrokes into the shell, etc.  Also scrolling complex pages will show a crosshatch screen while the drawing tries to catch up (no pause however).  The machine could be underpowered for some people's tastes but not for mine.  I lose no productivity with a little noticeable lag every now and then (maybe a couple times a day).Installing the extra software like above takes effort, but I believe it is worth it.  For one thing I can tar up my home directory and reinstall it after the OS is upgraded.  Using this machine for software development purposes (emacs and ruby in my case) is a breeze.  It is highly productive and cost effective.

4247,"I bought this Chromebook with the intention of getting a light, super portable laptop for casual use, with the expectation that I would be able to flip it on to do some writing, chat online, play some quick games here and there, watch videos, etc. When I got it in the mail, I was pretty pleased. It was pretty light and compact, just as it seemed. The keyboard was nice and ergonomically designed; while I yearned for a numpad, it wasn't a big deal. I could turns Caps Lock off! Unfortunately, all these things failed to make up for the small - and big - flaws that I had come to encounter.1. Numerous games, including one of the most popular and well-advertised games on its service - Bastion, do not work on this specific Chromebook due to the way that Google designed it. In this case, the developer of Bastion would have to modify the game to work with Google's new updated OS.2. While playback started out okay, it's now a hot mess. On YouTube - and only YouTube I might add - I can no longer have videos playing in the background while I browse the Internet, as even basic actions outside of the YouTube window will cause the audio to become a garbled mess, often so severe a problem that the audio will stay like that until I return to the tab and reload.3. Touchpad can never be disabled. I understand that they wouldn't want people to accidentally disable it without a mouse to take over its duties, but that's why you include a button somewhere to do that.4. Chrome Toolbox - an extension designed by Google - is not supported by the Chromebook, a device designed by Google. Which means that I have to just cross my fingers and hope that someone made an equivalent for this extension that neglected Chromebook users can utilize, since Google apparently can't fit ""loyal customer appeasement"" into its budget. Which also means that I have to suffer with the lack of a confirmation message if I accidentally close my window and possibly lose very important data.5. Cleaning up documents is a horrible mess. I often have documents written that get scrapped, so I had a lot of documents, due to Chrome's auto-save. Unfortunately, Google didn't think to implement a convenient means by which its users can examine what documents are from a preview screen. Mass deletion is also not nearly as easily done as it is on a normal computer.I'd add more, but I'm afraid that my computer will suddenly crash without warning and cause me to lose this review. In short, do not buy this, or any Chromebook, for that matter. There are better laptops that do the same thing for about the same price.

4264,"I got this computer for Christmas from my boyfriend. We decided to go with the Samsung because I usually love Samsung products, and the computer was really cheap, and little enough that I could carry it to and from school.When I first opened the package, I was pretty excited. The computer was shiny and really cute. As soon as I turned this computer on, my excitement died. This computer is absolutely WORTHLESS if you don't have an internet connection. Which, at first didn't bother me too much, because where will I be that I won't have internet. A lot more places than I originally planned apparently, because I soon found out that a lot of the time I couldn't even sign on to my computer, not even to connect to new wireless internet connection.If you're in a public place, like at school, and someone else near by connects to the internet, this computer drops connection, making it useless.Once you have an active internet connection, this computer is still pretty much useless. It is compatible with absolutely nothing. If you try and download songs from Amazon, you have to get a download from Google Play allowing you to download the song from Amazon. I haven't even tried getting iTunes.You can't open pdf files to download, or even just view them. Anything that hasn't come directly from Google will not work on this computer at all. The only files you can have are your Google docs.I changed the password to my Gmail account on a different computer, and it took me hours to get my computer to sign me on, I don't know what happened. I typed my new password, it didn't work, I typed my old password, it didn't work. I restarted my computer and tried both, it didn't work. I don't know how I got it to work, but eventually my new password let me in.The Pros!! It's very cute, and sometimes it's fast on the internet. That's it. That's all it's got. Oh, and it's cheap. Those are the only pros to this computer. And now, a short 6 months later, I'm looking to buy a new laptop entirely.My advice!! Spend the extra $100 and get a computer worth your time.

4273,"Got the wife a Chromebook to replace her aging HP laptop since what she does is all Internet based.  Seems like a nice, little machine but the one that we got had a problem with the wi-fi capability.  Sometimes it was as quick to display a webpage as you would expect on our high speed network. Other times, you would just see the rotating circle progress indicator for a long while then get a message indicating the webpage was unavailable.  This was for common sites like GMail, Chrome App store, Facebook, Ancestry, etc.  Obvious there was something wrong with the the wi-fi capability in this unit.  Called Samsung support and guy suggested doing a reset and told me how (Ctrl+alt+shift+r at logon screen) but that did not help. Wi-fi problem persisted. Also, unit was unable to see our networked printer for Cloud Print.  Returned the unit to Amazon after having it in the house less than 12 hours.  My advice: Don't waste your time.

4290,"I've had my Chromebook for about two weeks now and have given it an ""average use"" test run on it over that time. It does what I wanted it to do, has the limitations I'd expected from the reviews I'd read, and is generally excellent value for the price.Pro:--great keyboard--I like the touch and layout in the space. It's a tiny bit ""clicky""  but not annoyingly so. I miss the delete key and some of the quick key options I'm used to with a PC, but I'm adapting. The most commonly used key commands (for copy, paste, print, save, etc,) are unchanged. I don't like back-lit keyboards so that's not a problem for me. Some reviewers have noted its absence.--excellent battery life--I've gotten a little over 8 hours on a charge with using it for text/writing, web surfing and having it ""sleep"" overnight. That's not brilliant, but for a working laptop at this price, I'm a happy camper.--light weight yet solid. I tend to be gentle with my toys so I'm not bothered by the plastic case. Yes,there may be some give on the keyboard, but only if you have a very hard touch or you're trying to test its limits. (I checked. It flexed, but I had to push.) I'm a fast touch typist with a light touch and I generally don't rest my wrists on the computer when I'm keying so have encountered none of the squeaks or flex that other reviewers have mentioned.--VERY fast boot and wake up. Actually takes longer to shut down than to boot. Also very easy on the battery during sleep...I left it three days on sleep (unintentionally), yet saw surprising little drain on the battery.--screen is decent IF you have the right tilt and aren't trying to share it with others. It's a one-person screen. But get the tilt or view angle off by a few degrees and it goes to poor and straight on to unviewable. But what do you expect for the price? (Okay, the screen on my old Acer netbook is better, but that sucker is SMALL.) For most uses, I've set brightness at around 75 or 80%, so that helps. At max brightness, it's plenty bright for me, but not for a couple other people who tried it out.--Nice size for working. I like my laptops actually on my lap, and the light weight coupled with a good size makes it a very easy machine to work with for hours at a time.--Surprisingly decent speakers for such a cheap machine. I use a Logitech lapdesk under it so there's no muffling effect of fabric. They aren't high end, by any means, but they're actually significantly better than the speakers on my $900 Toshiba or the several Dell Inspiron laptops I've worked with.--Quiet (no fans for solid state!) and cool. Very nice!--I really did enjoy NOT having to install all the other software and going through all the system setup and adjustments that are needed for a new pc.  Take it out of the box, plug it in, get on-line, go do something else for 5 minutes, and it's ready to go. When you consider how much those services and software packages can cost, this machine is an even better value than its wallet-friendly $249 price. Add ordering it from Amazon and getting free shipping and it's a super value. And not once it two weeks has the shut down been postponed because the system is ""installing 1 of 18 updates"" like MS is so fond of doing.CONS (or at least IFFY)--Other reviewers had mentioned problems with the browser and web page display. I use Chrome on other computers, both desktops and laptops, and like it a lot. Unfortunately, there really is a problem with Chrome's performance here. I've experimented with setting my 4 year old Acer (1G ram), my Kindle Fire, and the Chromebook to bring up the same page off the same wifi service at about the same time. There were times even the Kindle outperformed the Chromebook, and the Kindle is not a speed demon. I really did expect Chrome to work better than it has on this machine.  It's adequate, but not what I would have expected on a machine that is specifically intended to use Chrome as its centerpiece. And it does stutter and seem to lose track of pages at times. This is my single greatest reservation with the thing. I would have liked Netflix capability going in, but knew it wasn't there and crossed it off my list. But I really did expect it to do better with a wider range of websites. That took a star and a half off the review, right there.  I also wish I could get rid of the ""recently visited"" boxes on the screen of each new tab. I prefer either high-use apps or nothing but the background graphic in that space, but haven't figured out how to change it (and haven't tried very hard--it's not that important, just a nuisance).--Trackpad is acceptable, no better. I've found the trick is to use a firm touch.  It's actually less responsive than the trackpad on my old Acer. It helped to set the speed all the way to the top. System works fine with a nano-wireless mouse if you want one. However,an inadvertent brush of your palm will shoot the cursor off somewhere else, which is annoying. It can happen on any laptop, but it does happen more often with the Chromebook.--I knew going in that I was stuck with Google Docs for offline work (it has improved but still isn't really more than merely acceptable for basic work) or a Chrome app service like Zoho for online work. I actually installed Google Drive on a couple other laptops and a desktop and set it for offline work to test it out before I ordered the Chromebook . The print facility and offline performance were okay, but I'm still counting off a half star because Google docs isn't wonderful and you have no other real options on this system .Update Dec 16, 2012: I've been experimenting with MS Office Web Apps through SkyDrive on the Chromebook and been very pleased. So long as I have a wireless connection I can edit and work on my Word and Excel documents with ease. Some of the quick key commands aren't available since Chromebook doesn't have the same keyboard structure, which isn't a huge problem (I use a lot of keyboard commands in preference to the mouse because it's so much faster). Of course, you have to be online to take advantage of the apps, which means you're still stuck with Google Drive and Google Docs when you're offline so the half star off remains. I assume the same on-line functionality would apply if you're a regular Mac person and use CloudOn, but can't confirm that.--the ports on the back side are set a little close. I haven't had problems because I'm not using them for much except the mouse on occasion, but it could be a problem for those who want to connect multiple devices.Overall, the Chromebook is a good value and a decent machine. I'd buy another...unless I suddenly, miraculously, join the ranks of the wealthy 1% who think the cost of a top-of-the line Mac or ultrabook, plus software, is just pocket change. Until then,I'll stick with my Chromebook as a light-weight, long battery life alternative for basic writing/spreadsheet work and some web surfing or email.Update Dec 16, 2012: For what the Chromebook can do well, I love it. Love love love the keyboard. Love the light weight and long battery life and fast boot. It's so easy to grab and check something. Love being able to work in bed, out in the yard, haul it around without having 7 pounds of computer and chargers in the bag on my shoulder or worrying whether the battery will last. However, Chrome still hangs up on the web. Example: Every week, I check the NFL standings [Go, Broncos!!] and every single time,Chromebook hangs up....I scroll down the page, then I scroll back up and find I have to refresh the page because some of the information bars from the very top of the page are now superimposed on the stats. Never happens on Chrome on any of my other machines--I checked--so this is definitely a Chromebook problem. Still,I expect the problem will be resolved eventually. If not with updates to this OS,in future editions of Chromebook. And I'll definitely be in line to order the next generation when it arrives.

Fortunately, an AT&T Hot Spot now works here, so I'm very happy so far.The notebook is lightweight - feels lighter than my Kindle Fire - and the keyboard is full size so it's easy to use - important because I'm a writer. Customer Service has also been easy to reach and helpful - very important because the instructions for using the notebook are somewhat difficult to understand and often incomplete. If you don't get the help you need, try again. One CS rep didn't understand my problem and told me the notebook was defective; the next rep gave me the answer I needed. Chrome has been a learning curve for me. I'd used it a couple years ago but it's changed a lot. Most recently I had a MacBook and using this is a lot different in many respects, If you're not familiar with Chrome and need to hit the ground running, you probably won't be happy during your learning period.

On top of that, it once in a while will drop internet connection and quickly pick it back up, no problem unless you are, say, typing a spreadsheet.  It only saves a cell when you press enter, meaning if it drops the internet, it deletes everything in the cell that you were typing and you have to start over (annoying if there is a lot of text in the cell).  Powerpoints are unable to be opened, you have to upload it into google drive, then open it in google's format, which always screws with the formatting of the slides, makes it very difficult to read.Cannot figure out how to use podcasts, there are a couple of crappy apps that say they will allow you to, my school has a podcast of recorded lectures, after 2 hours of trying to figure out how to use it, nothing.

I've been very happy with the 550, but when this new version was released at only $249 I couldn't resist buying it (I'm married to a geek, so you can never have too many gadgets around the house).Here's what I love about this laptop - it's incredibly thin and light. However when you use it it feels big - the keyboard is a full-size one (the keyboard on the 550 is great too, but this is better) and the trackpad is huge too for a laptop this size. An improvement over the previous version is the trackpad surface - it's very smooth (almost feels like glass)which makes scrolling a breeze. Overall, the hardware is great and it looks really good (especially for the price tag)I was not expecting any surprises with the software since my old 550 has the latest features (thanks to automatic updates). However I was pleasantly surprised by the speed of the new 550 - it boots up quickly, pages load really fast too and all in all it's great to use. There are also a few new add-ons that are an improvement as well - apps that create a Google Doc, Slide or Spreadsheet with one click, as well as a new Camera app that's a lot of fun. I hope Google releases these for my old 550 too.All in all, I'm very happy with this laptop and highly recommend it - great features and usability for an amazing price. A great Christmas gift idea!

Oh boy, works right out of the box...yea if you can get past the opening.  Which Wi-Fi are you using?.  Uh, I'm using 3G.... no place for that on the opening page.  Back to the instructions.  Oh, I have to put a USIM card in the slot on the back.  What USIM card?  Nothing in the box but the notebook and cord.  OK, I'll chat with Amazon.  No go, they say politely  I have to talk to Samsung so I start a chat with Samsung.  Samsung is very sorry but they have nothing to do with the USIM card and I have to get hold of Verizon.  On to Verizon, still keeping my cool.  At Verizon I got a real person and a very nice woman who had never heard of the Chromebook.  After much consultation with the others at work she said no one there had heard of any connection with Chromebook and she put me on hold and called Samsung which was closed.  She even Googled the site to make sure it promised Verizon.  She is calling me back as soon as Samsung is open.  The experience was very positive but she did say I was the first to call.  I asked her if I got a prize.  Now I will wait to get the card and hopefully all the wonderful reviews on line will come true for me, sigh!  Just be sure you have all your ducks in a row before you try to use 3G.

4410,"I'm pretty tough on laptops.  I spend a good 12-14 hours a day on them and they tend to burn out pretty quickly.  My Lenovo recently died and I needed to send it back to the manufacturer for some warranty work.Well, I'm incapable of being away from a computer for a few days, and my daughter was going to need a laptop soon anyway, and I decided this would be a good temporary fix for me-and a permanent for her.I hate it.  I hate it so much.  If you only do a few things at a time, this probably won't be a problem, but I have 6-8 internet tabs open at a time and the memory just can't keep up.  It's so frustrating to have tabs that constantly have to reload because there isn't enough memory.Granted, this only has 2 gig of RAM.  I knew that might be a problem going into it, but I was hoping I'd be able to deal with it.  I can't. I've almost thrown it out the window a time or two.The other issue I have it that I really dislike working from the cloud.  I don't mind having it as a backup, but I don't want to deal with my printers being stored there, or anything like that.Firefox is my browser love.  Of course, I can't use it here.  There are things Firefox can do that Google Chrome just can't.  Or maybe I can't find those options.  Or maybe there just a pain in the butt to get.  Either way, it's frustrating.All in all, I don't want this.  I don't even want my daughter to have it because I'll have to deal with it when she can't figure something out.It's basically a tossable computer, in my opinion.  I didn't, and still don't, expect much from it.  Once it stops working, or annoys me too much, I'll just toss it instead of getting it repaired.  If I loved it, I still wouldn't get it fixed and I'd just buy a new one.  For the price, why not?It was a cheap computer, not a long term option for me.  I guess it did it's job by holding me over until my laptop was fixed.  Meh.

At the welcome screen, it asks you to choose your internet connection (the computer will NOT work without an internet connection).  I selected our home network.  It would not connect, even though there were other devices connected.  I called tech support and waited over 20 minutes to speak to a person.  He was very nice and took me through the steps to ensure it was not a communication problem between the computer and the router settings.  Everything was set properly.  The next step was to reset the computer.  It still wouldn't work.  So he suggested I try to pirate my neighbors internet.  After contacting them and getting the password, the computer connected to their network and I was able to set up the computer.  We disconnected from the neighbors internet and tried to connect again to our network.  It worked.  We used it for about 2 hours, listening to music, hooking it up to the TV and watching videos from youtube.  The graphics seem great, the speed seems to be good.  When we were finished, we closed the computer and put it back on the charger.  The next day, we wanted to listen to music.  So we opened it up, and again it would not connect to the network.  Recheck the router setting.  Another call to tech support and another 20 minute wait on hold, a person came on the line.  She was very nice and suggested I reset the computer again.  I did, and it still would not connect to the network.  Her next suggestion was to reset my router, which I did.  It still would not connect.  Her only other suggestion was to send it in for a technician to look at it.  That is when I told her that I would be returning it and purchasing a different computer.My husband bought me a Samsung tablet for Christmas and I thought it might be a Samsung issue in communicating with my linksys router.  So I got my tablet out and tried to connect it.  My Samsung tablet connected to the network without a problem.  I also have a Dell Laptop and an Asus notebook that have no problems.  Seems to me that the Chromebook has some glitches it needs to work out.After reading some of the reviews, I also wanted to address the charger.  When my husband first tried to connect it to the computer, he thought he broke the pin (he didn't).  The charger is tiny and seems cheap.  I am not sure how long it would last without having to either replace the charger or send the computer back for repair of the pin.

However Google docs does not work right and if you try to change the view size the curser becomes unstable and does not align with where you are typing. And changing back the origional size does not help. Once it becomes unstable it stays that way. The only way out is to convert it to a MSWord document and then reconvert it to Google doc. This is a well known problem that google has not addressed for years, but the short is that if you plan to do any word processing on the computer your better served buying something else. Since Google docs is the only word processing software that works on this computer, if you plan to use it for word processing think again. I found it borders on useless. For surfing the web it is fine, but if you intend serious writing work with Google docs forget it. I wish I'd gotten something else.

4443,"I ordered this item on Amazon for a friend. The following is the long-time use review by him:--I have been using chromebook actively over an year now and I am completely convinced that this device or rather Chrome OS is nothing but a con job. Google should know that just because it's cheap doesn't mean that I am willing to throw away 250$ for this piece of crap. I bought the cheapest Chromebook and yet I am so full of regrets. Btw, this is the only laptop I had (or could afford) in the past year and I was using is quite actively. Google has frustrated me to an extent that I have come here to write this review.The good things about the chromebook are its battery, the keyboard and trackpad (for this price) and it stays cooler than other laptops and charges quickly. Sorry but this list ends here. As far as the rest of the build, my screen has scratches / imprints of the keyboard (including the letters) and all the edges around it. Bluetooth is a complete joke. I was expecting to share my internet connection from Android phone using Bluetooth. It doesn't even share files!! I have tried at least 10 phones unsuccessfully trying to transfer a file. Nope. Connect the Android phone using USB cable. Nope. Doesn't show unless you root your phone and mount it as USB storage. And mind it both are from the same damn company. Till many months, WiFi had a bug that it would disconnect and which required me to keep restarting the Chromebook.Let me come to Chrome OS. Window manager is bad, really bad. Even now there is a bug in the window manager (left click starts switching between windows and I need to restart the damn device). Chrome OS cannot do simple things like zooming into a photo or calculating size of a folder. Team viewer, dropbox, navigation won't work. Videos are jarry and only a few codecs and formats work. Music playback is again jarry and skips if you happen to use your laptop to do anything else at the same time. For a long time, the Secure Shell application didnt import identity files correctly. Till now I dont know how to make a .ssh/config file and clearing known_hosts (without rooting the device). I cannot upload files to an FTP. There is no SFTP. Cannot connect to SMB or file shares. RSTP streaming will not work. X11 forwarding does not work. VNC for arm came much later, and still has bugs, especially with the mouse pointer. It is not even good as a thin client. Chrome webstore is a joke. I dont even have a decent code editor on my laptop. Now I know Google will tell me that to use a notepad I have to the great cloud, bla bla. They don't get a simple point. What good is carrying a whole laptop if I can't make a simple doc or edit a simple code on it without connecting it to the net. A 20 year old computer could do all this with 20 times less the processing capacity. Google docs sucks. You can just make something, yes, but the output is far far away from other word processor or presentation software. I have to import that into Word or Powerpoint and make it atleast displayable to the world. Google Drive is another joke. I cannot sync folders. Each file has to be manually clicked to be synced, which obviously doesn't allow new files to be synced. And so many people have written about this in the forums. There goes all cloud philosophy to the dustbin. It seems Google cares little about the quality of its software and has conveniently offloaded the testing of its products to its consumers. For those who think it's a tablet with keyboard, sorry for you because there are hardly any apps compared to Android or iOS.Rooting and putting crouton is a pain. It's just inconvenient, slow and frustrating if this is your primary work laptop. Even Libreoffice barely works. Nothing else. Lot of packages are not available for arm. And the worst of all, the white 30 sec ridiculous message which pops when you boot the device which invites you to come and reset the device. Four times this has happened to me that someone pressed ESC and SPACE at boot and entire device got factory reset. Given that, you can't have anything important locally on your laptop if you have rooted it.And off course, not to mention, everything I do is sent directly to Google to sell me off. I search for a bag and two hours later I see advertisements of bags all around me.Given all this, is it worth carrying around Chromebook with you? No! Simply because of the one fact I am tired of apologetically explaining people what my laptop cannot do. If you want to buy this, be absolutely clear about one thing - it is not a laptop, not a tablet with keyboard, nor a thin client and trust nothing apart from browsing to work on this, nothing, yes NOTHING.

4459,"We've had our Chromebook for over 4 years now and our children use them regularly work school work and Khan Academy.  They're dependable and serve the purpose we purchased them for.My concern at the outset was with parental controls.  In 2012, there were controls but they were easily overridden, and Samsung made no attempt to advertise a clear solution for parents who want to control what their kids see or dont see.  We turned to Netgear router for a solution, but since then, the Chromebook itself offers a decent solution.  Below are two links offered by Jeff (who commented here)  which detail how parental controls now work.  (Thanks Jeff!)[...][...]Original 2012 Review (Outdated)Title: No Parental Controls; Samsung should point customers towards Netgear RoutersI'm giving this a one-star rating to point out that the Chromebook as no meaningful parental controls.  Controls that are available are easily disabled by anyone over 5 years of age who can look at the browser's plug-ins.  Samsung should anticipate that a good percentage of their customer base will be parents and they should provide basic information regarding parental controls for people like me who had no idea what to do for months.  Eventually, I learned that routers (e.g. Netgear Routers) provide the most effective parental controls.  This is in contrast to attempting to install parental controls on all devices - which is unwieldy at best or impossible in the case of the Chromebook.  Samsung should provide this information at the outset as it's incredibly important to restrict access to what a 10 or 11 year old actually sees.

She loves it even more.As a web browser, this device works very, very well.  This is the full desktop version of chrome, and it works just as well and is quite acceptably fast. Access to gmail, google drive, google docs, etc is flawless.  Every website I tried worked perfectly as expected.The device itself is high quality with excellent battery life.

4480,"Shipped promptly and well packed. Informative book. There is however a later version by a different author that I wish I had spotted before buying this one.  < This was my book review which was meant to be just that. Since this will show as an edit of the book review, I'll have to that I give the computer _3 Stars_. Amazon seems to have credited my book review as being for the computer. They show them together under with only one reference.  Perhaps because both were ordered together. Anyway first the pros. Well made, and feels sturdy. No more worried about dropping than about my MacBook. The wireless connects great wherever I am. State and city library, Starbucks, Target etc, no problems. A pleasure to carry, much better that my Apple laptop, light. No problem with doing my email, banking paying bills, general search etc. Cons: The OS is touted as being very fast. It is not. I image the lower grade processor is to blame for this. Even though it recognizes flash drives and strangely a external hard drive which I use for backup storage; it will not backup to them. However it will with no problem at all copy the same file to Google Docs in the Cloud.Also will not backup video clips. I'm speaking of MP4 which it is supposed to handle.On both to an external device, it says that more ""permissions"" are needed. Video clips are a BIG thing with me. There absence may mean a return of this item. Since the system has been around since sometime in 2011 (?), these issues should have been solved a long time ago. Even staying in a browser, the Chrome desktop could have been made a whole bunch simpler with a _finder type of page, like on the Apple OX series of OS. Everything there in one place without so much jumping around. Summation: Even being as small a OS as it is, it could still be Simpler. Unless the download issues are solved I feel I may return it. I have until Feb. 28 to do so. A change either way, I'll be back with an update.  March 1, 2013 UPDATE (last one)  Well I am going to keep it. I have not been able to resolve the issues I have with it. Keeping in the hope that I can pull it out in a month and find that some problem solving updates have posted. What I am going to do in the meantime is try to find the money for a new Mac Air. The Chromebook I probably will get rid of down the road. I have the feeling that this for Google is going to be a when we get to it, we'll fix this or that. It'll always be a low priority. I hope I'm not coming across as a grouch, but I hoped for more.

For example if I wrote ""and then the dog went outside"" but decided I wanted to use another sentence, so I backspaced but went back a little to far and erased lets say three sentences, I couldn't just undo and get them back. I would have to re write them all over memory (yes that has happened to me with this computer, twice! one time it just deleted my whole essay! I had to rewrite the whole thing from memory!)

4519,"Terrible. Just terrible. Who had the bright idea of making a laptop that can't even print? This piece of scrap metal is so deplorable, I cannot fathom why anyone would buy it in their same mind after looking at the specific details of it. Perhaps we did expect a bit much from not a $250 laptop as some say, but $280 spent! Even worse, according to a paper with information on the laptop, it was in used condition! Now, let's look at the specifics. I'd rather not make myself look like a rambling idiot without talking about what specifically makes this laptop a regrettable purchase.The laptop we (my little brother and I) ordered was supposed to come with 3G Internet from Verizon. We might as well have ordered without. We were unable to successfully load a single web page in the 30 minutes we tried to use the computer. We had to connect to the house's Internet to be able to gain access to the laptop. And even then, the laptop still ran pretty slow.As others have previously stated, it feels extremely cheap. The laptop feels as if it were made from the plastic used to make cheap, generic phone cases. The mouse was also difficult to maneuver and click.I'm not sure what I expected from a laptop that cost $280. I really don't. But I surely was not expecting this. I thought it would be much better in terms of craftsmanship and speed. The entire family gathered around my brother and I and all told us we should return it while I was trying to sign in to Google Chrome. After spending almost 40 minutes ( 40 minutes too much), we put it back in the box. We really hope that we get through the return process fairly easy, but some other reviewers don't seem to be faring well.Do not buy this laptop if you want a laptop. Apparently, another reviewer was told by the company that the laptop ""is not meant to be used as a laptop."" Really. Don't buy this laptop. You will end up most likely regretting it. It isn't worth it. At all.

4520,"One day. I got this Tuesday and here it is Wednesday and I'm packing it back up and sending it back. Just... yuk!I thought I had thoroughly researched Chrome Books and knew what I would be getting. I didn't think the limits of the Chrome OS would be a problem. On both counts, I was completely and utterly wrong. I want to be able to install programs from the internet, such as my Yahoo Messenger (I'm not a fan of the messenger within Yahoo mail..) and the Chrome book won't allow that. It also won't allow me to download my HP wireless printer drivers in order for me to print. Oyi!What does work, works well. Using Google services on the Chromebook is pleasant. Google Drive is integrated right in there, as are Google's Web-based Word, Excel, and PowerPoint knockoffs. Gmail and Google Calendar are great too, and I have few complaints about the built-in Calculator or Files window. What doesn't work is an abysmal failure: There is virtually nothing useful outside of these apps in Chrome's Web app store that works well and consistently. If you dig deep enough you may find an app that's supposed to do what you want, but it never works optimally and it shouldn't be this hard.I knew the offering of apps in Chrome were very limited but again, I just thought I could work through it all. And I hear there are work-arounds but if you're not an IT Geek, you're not going to know how to get there and really, why should you have to work that hard to get anywhere?! So nope. It's going back.The price may be nice on these Chromebooks but you have to weigh that against the limitations and what works for you. I liked the size of it and the weight, and the speed, but nothing else. I'm going to look for that small 2-in-1 from Acer I want and stick to a true operating system like Windows or Apple.

Next day, it was out of juice (plugging it in showed that). Then, the day after that, I was looking at a video, paused it, closed the lid. As I was walking away from it sound started coming out of the speakers. It had started to play the video.  I've noticed that to properly come out of sleep takes a few seconds, but sometimes when I open it the display is instantly on. This seems wrong.  Anyone else have this problem?Second, the design defect:This thing is impossible to open without having fingernails, and even with fingernails it's very, very awkward to open.  Sometimes I can't quite get it and the thing clamps shut from being opened an inch or two.  I have a Mac Book and in the 3 years I've had it I've maybe once had that problem.  Every single time I open this device I'm reminded how badly it's made.  I can live with this one, though.I hope I'm the only one that has the first problem.  I'm taking 2 stars off for this until I know if it's a design or manufacturing defect.Taking 1 star off for the second problem.  It's just really annoying for me.Other than these two issues, I like it.  It is what it is, a laptop that runs Chrome.

4535,"I wanted a tiny laptop on which I could store my pictures and surf the internet.  This seemed perfect to suit my needs.  Ha.  Just the file storage alone on this laptop is enough to make me want to throw it through a window every time I use it.  I truly consider just eating the $250 I spent on this hunk of junk every time I open it and buying a real computer with a real operating system.  Google is great for searching and email, but if you want to organize your files or shrink a file size or use your mouse (which regularly disappears and then forces me to restart the computer), spring for the $150 and get Windows or go all out and get a Mac.  There's no easy way to find answers on this thing and I can't even use Rosetta Stone's online software because it regularly freezes on this computer (which it does not do on my husband's new laptop with a Windows OS).*Just another note* I got on here because now I've plugged in my iPod and it won't sync on this computer either.

4563,"Others have commented about the new Chromebook hardware, and the browser is well-known already (it operates identically on the Chromebook), so I'll comment about the OS features outside of the browser, about which very little information is available. Bear in mind that Google updates the OS frequently, so anything I say is subject to change at any time.There's a new app called Files that's a file manager, analogous to Windows Explorer or the Finder. It always shows two drives: Downloads, on the local file system, and Google Drive. You can copy between them, make folders, rename files, etc.If you mount an SD card or USB drive, you can perform the same operations with those drives, too. I was able to mount a Mac-formatted (HFS) drive, but not write to it. When I tried, I got an error message AND the OS got into a state where it would refuse to copy anything, even if the HFS drive wasn't involved. Rebooting cleared this up.You can't access networked drives (shares) at all.If you have a Google Docs file on a local drive, including the built-in drive, you can open it with Google Docs to work on it, but it seems that there's no way to create such a file from the app. You have to get it there by copying it from Google Drive. This use of a local file is completely different from the new offline capability that the Google Docs apps have. That gives them access to a local cache of the online files, unrelated to the files you see with the Files app. My advice is that if you want to work with those apps offline, do it the official way.Other notes:My bluetooth mouse, which I prefer to the touchpad, worked perfectly.The Chromebook looks very much like my Macbook Air. Same size, same weight, similar appearance. The Air is more refined, and it also costs more than four time as much.I got the Chromebook because when I'm not on my main computers (an iMac or a Windows box) I spend all my time in Chrome. The Chromebook is perfect for this, as others have noted. I was using an Air for this purpose, which it's great at, of course, but so is the Chromebook.When I take photos, I shoot raw. You can copy raw files from a card to another device with the Chromebook, for in-the-field backup, but you can't view the raw files (that is, you can't view the JPEG preview that's inside them). You can on Windows, MacOS, or an iPad. In this respect, an iPad is a more complete field computer for a photographer who wants backup and a little viewing, but, unlike the Chromebook, you can't attach an external drive, and an iPad only has so much internal memory. It works for me while I'm on vacation, but it wouldn't work for a pro. Not enough space.You can certainly upload a raw to Picasa Web and view it there, but this is impractical for the bulk of the images you'll shoot in the field.The above viewing issue applies only to raws. JPEGs work fine.As an experiment, I wrote a text editor as a packaged app, which means it loads locally in Chrome and has full access to local files. It worked fine on the Chromebook, as I would expect. However, it seems that it is tossed out on a reboot, so you have to load it from an external disk each time you boot. As packaged apps are very new and still experimental, this is obviously a temporary issue. I noticed that there's a way to pin the app icon to the launchbar, which is nice. Pinning doesn't keep it from being tossed out.The Chromebook needs work, but I give it five stars anyway. The Google people are smart and hard-working, so I expect things will get better rapidly, especially as the new Chromebook seems to be a smash hit.

I was sold when Engadget said it was 80% of the macbook air experience at a fraction of the price. I'd say it's more like 60% of the macbook air experience, but that's still an incredible deal for the price.Drawbacks:You can't print. You can set up google cloudprint but I haven't gotten it to work yet. You can't do anything that isn't inside a web browser. 95% of my computer usage is inside google chrome anyway, so that's not a huge deal for me as a second computer. You can't edit video or do anthing else that requires more than a simple file system and a web browser.Advantages:The keyboard and touchpad are near-mackbook quality. That makes them better than 70 percent of all laptops out there. Not a small thing. I love the two-finger scrolling which you can reverse so it works like a mac. Google calls it simple scrolling. There is two-finger right click too.The screen is fine. I wish I could put the bottom-of-the-screen launcher bar on the side of the screen to save precious vertical pixels.Interface is good. I set up separate user account for each of my kids. Not as smooth as a mac but smoother than windows 7.Build quality is better than your average laptop but not up to macbook standards. Considering the price it's amazingly well put together.Bottom line:  For someone like me who spends most of my computer time in chrome for mac, this is a natural second computer. It would be great for a student computer. If you want to edit videos or do other things that don't work very well in a web browser you should look elsewhere.You could easily spend three times this much and get a computer with a lesser keyboard, lesser touchpad, and inferior build quality.

4603,"I bought this mainly to try out. For the price it's pretty hard to complain but if I had to do it over again I wouldn't. I thought with everything that Google offers for productivity it would be fine to use for work, but man was I wrong. The first thing that sucked was to find out that it doesn't support Android apps which in my mind is ridiculous, since its all Google, so your limited to what is offered strictly for the chrome browser. That is my main complaint. I have a tablet and phone that both run android and there really isn't anything that syncs them other than Google drive which doesn't work the way I was hoping. I really wanted Google Drive to be my go-to cloud storage since they give you 100GB when you purchase the Chromebook but it really doesn't compare to Dropbox which is what I am still using because it just works. As far as the machine goes it seems well built and pretty speedy. Like other reviewers have mentioned the keyboard is pretty fantastic. If your looking to do any kind of productivity outside of Google Docs than don't bother with this. If they were to let you run android apps on this machine it would be by far the best thing out there for the price, but until then it will continue to fall extremely short for most users.

4610,"This is an awful laptop, i saw commercials and ads for this laptop all over the place.  It seemed to be the perfect laptop for the perfect price.  It however was not.  It is about as useless as having one shoe when you aren't connected to the internet.  Without internet you can't do jack s***. Even when it does have internet, everything opens in a new tab in your browser, which causes crowdedness and makes the laptop appear cheap when you have 30 tabs open at once.  Literally everything opens in a tab.  Even when trying to do something as simple as write a word document, without internet you can forget it.  I had it for about 3 days and immediately returned it and went and bought an 11.6-inch ASUS touchscreen laptop from best buy.  This laptop (which is actually what i'm writing this review on) is amazing.  Do yourself a favor don't waste your time or money on the chromebook, it isn't even worth the $250 samsung is asking for it.  Even with wifi, it is a poorly put together machine.

4616,"My Chromebook was a gift to me during my Sophomore year of college. I am now about to graduate, and this lil' guy has been with me for 3 great years. So, let me start by saying that I DO recommend and endorse this product for any student.However, there are a few important things to note. I'll summarize my issues first, and then go into more detail below:Cons:>Cracked screen after 2.5 years of use>Slow and glitchy after 3 years>Limited capabilitiesPros:>Light, transportable>Excellent battery life>Quick start-upFirst, I am typing this review right now on my Chromebook with a cracked screen. This is the second time in 5 months that the screen has inexplicably cracked. I take great care of it, keeping it in a cool dry place when it's not in use, cleaning it regularly, and keeping it away from food or grease. The first time it cracked, I spent $50 to have a new screen shipped to me within a week, and then I replaced it myself with some help from a youtube video. Replacing the screen was easy (though expensive) but, to be clear, I fully admit that I may have replaced it wrong, and that might be why it has cracked again so soon. To further explain what I mean by ""cracked"": one entire portion of the screen is blotted out by colored lines and white lines crisscrossing up and down, and they seem to originate from a few obvious cracks to the left side of my screen. Photo attached.Second, for the past month or so it has been slow, glitchy, and occasionally it will completely freeze up. It hadn't done that at all in the previous two and a half years, so this is a very recent phenomenon. Weirdly enough, Google Docs is the most affected by the glitchiness. Lately when I try to type anything in Google Docs, it randomly skips characters as I type at my normal speed, so my words come out like gibberish. This glitch doesn't occur on any other website.Third, as most people have already noted, it does have limited capabilities. As a college student, I used Google Docs frequently and without any issues, so I was set. Video and sound quality is also good, which I appreciate. The wifi is consistently reliable. However, you can't download any programs or software, and certain Word or PDF documents come through like gibberish if you open up an email attachment or something similar. The Chromebook's programming is exceedingly simple.Now for the pros! Lots of people have already endorsed this product like crazy, so I'll be brief. I should start by saying that the Chromebook has so many benefits, it is truly worth the price and the reliability for the few years that it works. It is light and easily portable - I carry it around in a thick laptop case from class to class, without hassle. The battery life hasn't waned at all in its 3 years, and I haven't replaced the battery once. It also starts up pretty quickly even after 3 years. I'll be talking to someone about an article or video on the internet, and I can pull up said item of interest within a minute. Very handy.I loved my Chromebook. I think it's time to put it to rest. :)

4669,"I just found out today, after lots of wasted time fiddling with it, that my Chromebook will not connect to my personal hot spot via my iPhone, and I am extremely annoyed! There was no mention of this anywhere when I was reading up on the product before purchase. I just found today, among the fine print of the help menu, that mobile networking is ""not supported."" This is ridiculous, since I primarily bought this small, lightweight, supposedly versatile netbook for when I am ""on the go."" Save your money and buy an iPad instead. My sister was using my personal hotspot with her iPad, NO PROBLEM!!!Update on 4/9/13: I just changed my rating to 4 stars because I tried using my personal hotspot again when I was on a trip last week, and I'm happy to say that this time it worked!! I found I had to do the following to get it to connect: open the ""settings"" on my iPhone, and go to the page that has the personal hotspot password. I left that screen open on my phone and put it down near my chromebook. Then I clicked on the wifi icon on the lower right hand of my chromebook screen, then had it search for available wifi networks. After a few moments it would find my iPhone and, after entering the password the first time, reconnect automatically after that. I found that it almost always lost the connection after ""sleeping."" I'm not sure why I had to manually reconnect, but I'm just grateful that I was able to, and that I didn't have to reenter the password each time.So now I like my Chromebook much better!! It still feels a little plastic-y and cheap, but it certainly fills the bill when I am traveling and need access to online files and sites.

When that didn't work, they suggested I send it back. Also tried Google Ninja team. They had me punch several different keys at once for a reset, but that didn't work either. They suggested I send it back. I sent it back for a refund. Amazon said a replacement would be available the first part of 2013. I think I will wait until they have the bugs worked out...

Lastly, six hours of battery life MY FOOT! Keys get sticky often, its hard to select things, and 76% of the apps in the chromebook store are worthless.

4674,"Got my new Chromebook yesterday and was really excited to have an alternative device that I could type on.  99% of my computer time is while connected and the offline apps will be more than sufficient for this backup computer.  Setup went very smooth.  The screen looks like something from a laptop 5-8 years ago.  Others have mentioned the viewing angle, but you also have to constantly adjust the screen tilt.  I imagine alot of the cost savings were related to the screen.  I immediately noticed that I have one dead pixel near the center of the screen.  I have not decided if I will return for this issue.I would have rated this device 5 stars except I quickly found that video playback from all the major sites is not supported on this version of Chrome OS (running on Linux).  Netflix, Amazon Streaming and Xfinity DO NOT WORK.  Every site has a nice message to tell you that there is either a problem with the Flash plugin on Linux or playback is just not supported.  I am sure Google has every intention of fixing this, but they have been deceptive in their advertising where they show these sites being used on the new Chromebook.  Also interesting that this issue was not mentioned by the professional tech reviewers.No information comes with the machine and the tutorial at the beginning is sparse.  No info on how to change themes even though there are many nice ones on the Chrome Store.The plastic case scratches VERY easily and the back of the laptop is already scratched just from sitting on my lap.Overall a great concept and machine.  I hope that the popularity of the device will convince the developers to fix the video issues or alot of kids are going to be really angry this Christmas.  Seriously, why put an HDMI port on a machine if none of the major sites support playback??????????????????

4681,"So, let me begin by saying that I am a software engineer and there is no way that this would be able to keep up with all of my computing needs. That being said, the avg person should find that it performs everything they need outside of a few minor caveats; so here they are:Chrome OS is NOT for you if...1) You MUST use iTunes. If you have an iDevice and plan on using this to sync music, contacts, etc. It's simply not going to work. However if you only plan on listening to music and your library is on another machine you can use Google's Music uploader to add your songs to the Google Music web interface.2) You want to use this as your only computer with a printer that doesn't have Google Cloud Print support. If you have a PC or Mac on your network configuring Google Cloud Print is simple even with the oldest of computers.3) You must use Micro$oft Office and are not okay with either Google Docs or the new Office 365 web apps.Chrome OS IS for you if....1) You realize that there are modern web only alternatives for almost anything you would do on a PC.2) You want to use this as a secondary device that is more productive than a tablet.3) You want computer maintenance to be a thing of the past and want a device that ""just works"".Now I have read some of the negative reviews and seeing M$'s new Scroogled campaign let me clear up a few things:1) Netflix does work to a satisfactory level with minor performance issues. It helps to have all other tabs closed.2) This is a very thin and light plastic device with a VERY small power adapter. So if you abuse your electronics you might consider the HP Chromebook 11 (which has been pulled for now but I'm sure will reappear when they solve the heat issues with the power adapter)3) There are no added privacy issues over simply using the Chrome browser or Android. Other than logging on with a Google account there is nothing that says that you actually have to use their services. You can still use your favorite mail, calendar and even search engine.4) I have never had a crash (that I have noticed, it takes about 20 sec to restart and opens to the same tabs).In the interest of full disclosure I will say that there is the occasional task that I want to perform that cannot be done in Chrome OS, however there are multiple options to remote into my desktop in order to accomplish what I want to do. Chrome has a new easy to use remote access application that is very simple with the only downside being that it doesn't resize the display of the target device to match like RDP. Speaking of which, there is a native RDP app that works quite well, but usually requires being on the same network. Same goes for VNC. The last free alternative that I have used and it works quite well is LogMeIn.

4682,"I don't know if you're like me, but I have three desires. One, the protection of my data. Two, portability. Three, a smaller laptop type device with all the capabilities of a typical laptop.My previous computer crashed due to a defective hard drive, and I found myself taking the longest time before buying the Chromebook. I also wanted something better than a typical tablet. Make no mistake this is a tablet on steroids. It is not a pc, but it is close offering most of benefits of a pc, and in some respects offers considerable advatages.I bought it at a well known national retailer for about the same price as Amazon. What made me decide to buy this computer was the excellent advice given by someone from google who worked at the store.May I say that in terms of sophistication and ease of use it far exceeds a tablet device. I own a Nook, but I would not use it for buying an airline ticket, for example.The following made me decide to buy:100 gb of free storage for two years, offering considerable saving on online storage.Able after easy setup to walk out of the store with it working.The possibility of google cloud printing.The fact that you press a button and it's on, like a calculator.It updates automatically.It has in built antivirus protection, so you do not have to purchase software.You have the full benefit of the google technology, including drive.You have a wide range of apps available, particularly for document production, and its compatible with MS Office, and ODT.It also has pdf apps that are excellent, and you can easily convert a document into a pdf for easy printing..Other factors I liked after purchasing.It's light, compact, and easy to carry.It's very quick at connecting to new networks if you're roaming.It has great battery life about 6.5 hours, and this can vary depending on the nature of your usage.It even has an indicator which tells how much battery life is left.Google Drive offers you the opportunity to sign in and access your documents from anywhere.You can also create documents from anywhere, and even share documents online and allow other people to edit your document.Comparison to full pc laptop. For an extra $50 you can buy a laptop.On this computer you can do most but not all of what you can do on a regular computer. This is an absolutely excellent internet computing device. It's quick, and can process a lot of content, and you can have multiple windows open simultaneously without any noticeable slowdown. Unlike a regular PC it will never slow down.Automatic updates mean you never have to shut down it down like a regular pc to make updates.It does not have a cd player, so if cd burning is important, this is not for you. You can listen to your music collection on google cloud. I can easily listen to my amazon cloud music for example.It works with apps not with software. There are plenty of applications you can get at the google store many for free.I found that I cannot use Snagit on this computer to capture content. I use my pc for that.I love streaming movies on this machine. The pictures are crisp and vibrant, the sound excellent.I could watch a movie in bed without any of the awkward balancing you might have with a regular pc.Around the same time I bought this I also got a regular Dell PC. By comparison this is way faster to get going on. The Windows 8 apps on my new PC I found very annoying. They do not seem to work very well, and it's like running an obstacle course to get to a regular desktop setting.Although the google cloud printing was a major selling point, I went to another national retailer and bought an Epson 3520, which the salesperson assured me was cloud compatible. It's the most up to date. But when I attempted to integrate it with this machine it was not cloud compatible. So, if you do go for a cloud ready printer, research the makes and models before you go to the store, as salespeople do not always know.I like to Skype, so that was one of the considerations of getting the Chromebook which does not have skype. It does have calling and video calling capabilities called google talk, which I assume are comparable to skype.ExperienceI find that I love the Chromebook, and I tend to use it more than my two regular laptops, which I would be reluctant to take anywhere when I have this more compact, lightweight portable alternative. This is the number one seller in it's category on Amazon, and Samsung makes an excellent machine.As it's a Linux based operating system you will become acquainted with the Google Chrome browsing instead of window. The google drive you can access anywhere even from a different computer, and access your original bookmarks. I bookmark many sites, and I found the bookmarking somewhat preferable on the windows explorer browser.One of the ideas I love is the online storage, which means I could be in a different country yet still able to access 100 gb of content online, which offers considerable advantages over a tablet.I find this to be great hybrid between the tablet and laptop, and I highly recommend it.I think you will love it, and I hope this was helpful.

She likes to make web shows and also edit audio (both of which where a challenge due to lack of applications).The nail in the coffin is when the thing just stopped working and simply wouldn't turn on.  I called Samsung and after spending an hour on the phone with a technician who could barely understand me, he emailed me label to send it back to them for repair. Two weeks later they called me and said the 4-month old computer was not eligible for warranty repair due to 'liquid damage'.  This computer has never been wet, at all!!  I know from once spilling an entire cup of tea on a Macbook which still works, a little moisture should not destroy it anyway.

The keyboard is not bad, but it looks to be made for hobbits...it's too small.Even though it only costs 249.00 I simply can not justify having this product.

4708,"I have owned this Samsung Chromebook for quite some time now. I won't repeat what everyone else had already said about it, only very quickly that I love it to the point that it is now my go to laptop even at home. But I do want to give you some ideas how to turn this into a legitimate productivity machine.1. Office Documents:If you do a lot of office documents, Google now has Quickoffice integrated into the Chrome browser. For a document without a lot of fancy formatting Quickoffice works great. This should address at least 90% of most people's need. It seems to me that Quickoffice is actually available offline. A slightly negative aspect of it is that Quickoffice seems sluggish from time to time. I don't whether this is due to the ARM processor.If you want a more authentic MS Office experience you can always upload your document to Skydrive, which is very easy to do from a chromebook. You will then be able to edit Office documents using the Office Web App. I have done this many many times with no glitch what so ever. I have even edited complex Power Point presentations.But my favorite is to convert most of my Word documents into Google Docs. Editing them is extremely smooth, and they can be made available for offline editing. Most of the time I just use Google Docs. Sometimes I convert them into Word documents, which is easy to do on a chromebook or a PC.2. Google Drive and Dropbox  IntegrationNothing needs to be said here about Google Drive. Gdrive is fully integrated into the Chrome OS, and serves as a local drive. However, Dropbox is not. I'm still waiting for Google to come through, and rumor has it that it will eventually come.But there are easy get-around fixes. The first one I would recommend is a free app called SourceKit. It is an editor that edits files directly in your Dropbox and save them there. The second one I use is ShiftEdit (I use the free version). This is an even more powerful editor. You can set up your Dropbox account as the workspace, and then you can edit your files directly in dropbox. The ShiftEdit editor is much more powerful than SourceKit, but also more ""intimidating"" perhaps to setup. Of course, one can always use the web Dropbox interface, and it is just that an extra step to upload back to dropbox after you are done.3. LaTeXI do a lot of LaTeX, so it is important that the Chromebook can handle it. In the Chrome OS it is possible, as there are several cloud-based LaTeX engines. LaTexlab is one of them I actually like that is very easy to use. However, I find that it is a cinch to install Crouton Linux on this chromebook and switch back and forth between Linux and Chrome OS without reboot. It is also easy to install the full version of LaTeX and TeXmaker, one of the best LaTeX editors. So now I have completely solved the LaTeX issue.4. Editing/Making html webpageShiftEdit is a GREAT editor for making/editing webpages. It is almost as good as Adobe's Dreamweaver! I teach a class so I constantly need to update my webpage, and ShiftEdit is incredibly handy.5. SSH and SFTPI could not find a good app for it, so it was frustrating until I realized that SSH and SFTP are build into the Developer's Mode. For those of you who are willing to enter the Developer's Mode, go to Google and search for it. There are a ton of step-by-step guide for it. Once you have enable Developer's Mode, press ALT+CRL+T. A shell like window will appear. Type ""shell"" to enter a shell. Then just type sftp hostname to run it. It is command line based so you may have to learn if you haven't used it before. But it is very simple.I would love to know if there is a simpler way. (I could not get sftp to work in my Crouton Linux environment, perhaps because of the ARM processor).6. Free Phone Calls/Text MessagesThe Google Hangout works very nicely on this Chromebook. With it you can make/receive free calls to numbers in the US and Canada as long as you have a Google Voice number (free from Google). You can do this free even if you are outside the US. By the way, this is one area where the Chromebook definitely shines over a tablet. I have tried several VOIP apps on my iPad and my Android tablet. They quality has never been comparable.7. LinuxThis is one of favorite part. It is very easy to install Crouton Linux (again a ton of step by step guide), Once you install it it is trivial to switch between the two operating systems (CTL+ALT+SHFT+arrow to go from one to another). I installed the full version of LaTeX (TeX Live) and the editor TeXmaker. However, I have trouble getting LibreOffice, Skype, SSH and other programs to work, even though I noticed that others managed to get them to work on this machine. If any of you can help me out here I would really appreciate it.8. Offline capabilitiesA lot have been written about the offline capabilities (or the lack of them) of the Chromebook. Actually there are plenty of offline capabilities. In particular, you can almost always do enough offline and add just a little bit finishing touch to complete a task when you are back online again. For example, there is a nice offline plain text editor ""Text"". Google Docs are available for offline use, and I seem to be able to use QuickOffice with no problem. Gmail offline works great and is a must for every gmail user. Of course, you can always go the the Linux side and do a bunch of stuff. In a nutshell, I have never had any problem getting most of my tasks completed when I have no internet connection.9. Expanding StorageThe SD card slot is awkward because about 40% of the card will stick out. If you wan to permanently stick a SD card in the Chromebook as an expanded memory this can easily damage the card. There is a little trick solution to this nuisance. I bought a 32GB micro-SD card and on eBay a SD/USB adapter for the micro-SD card (less than $2). I then cut off the USB portion of it. The new contraption now is flush without anything sticking out, and it works. I did not discover this myself --- it was discussed on the web perhaps first among the Macbook Air community.Incidentally, I rarely put photos on it so to be 16GB is actually enough, even with Linux installed. If you plan to add music, I highly recommend Google Music.10. Concluding RemarksA lot of things have been written about chromebooks, and a common theme is that it is great for unsophisticated users but not so useful for advanced users. This is totally untrue.  I consider myself to be an advanced user, and I have been able to do just about anything I want to do on this chromebook.But if I have to buy a chromebook again, I may opt for one of those Intel Haswell chip based models. This particular chromebook can be sluggish sometimes. I have experienced it running Quickoffice, for example. I also have trouble install some apps which can potentially be very useful (e.g. Skype, SSH and LibreOffice on Linux). This is why I only give it 4 stars. It is possible that I am the only one experiencing these difficulties, and if so I would love to know.

4716,"You have to know that you get what you pay for. The Samsung Chromebook is excellent for it's price. And those cheesy videos they have that talk about how ""chrome os gets better with automatic updates"" are actually true. Having owned the Chromebook for almost a year now, nearly all my complaints have been patched over time. The main ones are full screen mode and HDMI playback.You'll notice pretty quickly that the 11-inch screen has an aspect ratio that makes it more of a widescreen, which is great. However, when it's only 11 inches, having a taskbar and browser controls take up a good amount of room. Especially when you're in google docs, and there's another inch of viewing space taken off by those controls, it feels like you're looking at your content through a mail slot. Full screen mode was frustrating at first because every time your cursor got near the top of the screen, a pop-up showed up reminding you that you were in full screen mode. Okay. The new update actually makes you're content full-screen, and there are these thin, unobtrusive, minimalist-style lines at the top and bottom of the display that represent your current tab and window. Your current tab/window are signified a white line while your other open tabs are grayed out lines. It may seem like a small thing, but it's helpful when you're using it.HDMI video playback actually works like it should have in the first place. Before, when you plugged in HDMI, your Chromebook display turned off and the monitor was the only display. Kind of useless. Watching movies on my TV through the Chromebook seemed cool in theory, but streaming was choppy and audio was delayed. Somewhere over the months that I've owned it, an update came through that changed it all. Now, the external display is defaulted to extend your Chromebook display, and a large variety of native resolutions are compatible. It even looked great on my 47 inch tv. And video playback is now flawless over HDMI.If you can't decide whether or not the Chromebook is for you, it's not too hard. If you are looking for a laptop for video/photo editing, programming, gaming, or other graphics and cpu intensive hardware, or even something that requires actual software, the Chromebook isn't for you. Essentially it's a browser. The computer just gives you the hardware to access the browser. The keyboard and trackpad are pretty good. If you like your bluetooth/wired keyboard and mouse better, go ahead and use them because they'll work just fine.If you're like me and really just use the Internet, the Chromebook is great. You have access to all Google products, Pandora, Spotify (the web player is getting better), and others. If Microsoft office is a must, check out the online SkyDrive by Microsoft, because they have online, dumbed-down free versions of Word, Excel, and Powerpoint on there that give you basic functions. SkyDrive works great on the Chromebook too. But Google Docs is getting better. It used to be pretty limited, but it's amazing how far it's come.Just test yourself with your computer you already have. Every time you log on, how many times do you not click on the Internet browser? I found myself finding this true. Why buy a crazy expensive laptop when this will do you just fine? Find out for yourself.UPDATE 1/21/2015Chromebook still runs great. Feels just as fast as ever. I take pretty good care of the laptop and it only has a few scratches on the outside of the lid. Still no regrets on the chromebook decision for everyday browsing and word processing.

4727,"This is a great laptop replacement for a regular college student. I bought this product on Newegg on a sale. Originally, my brother used it for school but he complained that it is not the right laptop for a student that needs to code and program. He gave it to me to use instead. I bring this to class everyday to take notes in or study between classes. We've had this Chromebook for about a year now.Upon startup, it takes awhile for it to connect to the internet, so you can't use it right after opening it. Also, the Chromebook is pretty much useless without an internet connection. You cannot even open Google Docs to take notes with without an internet connection. When I type on Google Docs, it does lag a little bit which requires me to type some letters again. Has all of your browsing needs such as Youtube, Facebook, eLearning, etc. Easy to just throw into your backpack and go despite needing it or not, it''ll always be there for you.The pros include: being light, portable, fast startup, long battery lifeThe cons: the outside scratches easily, needs an internet connection, slow processingOne problem I've encountered is that it is unable to open up very long documents or long powerpoints. My professor has powerpoints up to 150 slides, and this thing just does not load it up. And when it does, it takes an extremely long time. For extremely long Word documents, it does not load at all. The Google Appstore is not bad. I use things like GoogleKeep for checklists. Google Drive is great. It has a large storage space, and syncs up to everything. I have it on my iPhone, my computer, and my Chromebook. It connects everything, and I can access anything when I need it.I would recommend this if you need something light to take notes on for school. My brother says that there are budget laptops nowadays that you could find for this price if you are needing to do more than what a Chromebook can do.

So is a handy button that allows fast switching between windows.-Uses Google Drive- Saves automatically as I am typing my papers, and saves them to the Google Drive which I can access through any computer with my google account. This is the best feature so far! Example: Visited my parents 4 hours away from home, forgot my computer charger & needed to write a final. I just used their computer to log on to my google account and wrote my paper from there. It had auto saved so I picked up where I left off.-I have been using my chromebook for nearly a year- so far it has never frozen or crashed on me!-Compatible with NETFLIX.Cons:-This is my biggest hurdle: It only prints wirelessly. I have a wireless printer, but sometimes it connects and sometimes it doesn't. You CANNOT plug in a printer to this computer, it will not work. So half the time I have to email something to myself to print elsewhere.-That being said, the chromebook must be connected to wi-fi to operate past basic functions.-Not for large processes (gaming, etc)-Another hurdle: Not compatible with many popular file types. Not compatible with Microsoft Word :'(. Instead it has Microsoft Quick Office, which is very, very, very basic.-Has a webcam but not compatible with SKYPE!! Darn. With my husband in the military I was hoping to use Skype. Another :'(.Overall it is user-friendly (except for the wireless printing bit) and ultra portable. Great for everyday tasks, not so great with compatibility of various programs and file types. Google Drive is awesome.Hope this helps!

4732,"I have used an Apple computer of some sort since they came out. My old Macbook was showing the signs of imminent death and so I was planning on buying a MacBook Air. There's no Apple store near me, so I went to a Big Store (where I thought I'd get to try one). Nope. They had iPads and Windows laptops, but no MacBook Airs. I noticed the Chromebook display and checked them out.After looking at the iPads, I was (understandably) not impressed with the screen on the Samsung. Still, I tried it. The keyboard seemed really nice, nicer than the one on my MacBook. The touchpad, though a bit small for my taste, seemed responsive. The fact that it was plastic escaped me until I read a review. Oh, it's ""fake aluminum!"" Well, I don't care. It's a nicely designed machine. But, I didn't buy it then. I went home to research and think about whether I would be happy with using Chrome and no programs.So, I analyzed my computer usage for about a week and made the plunge. At $248, it seemed like a decent risk. After all, I've been spending almost a thousand dollars every three years for the latest Mac (yes, that's how long they've all lasted me). If I wound up using the Chromebook for a short while, or only when I'm out, it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.I've had the machine for a week now, and I'm thrilled. I love a good deal, and the Chromebook is that. No, it doesn't have a gorgeous screen. It looks kinda grainy (and yes, I know that's not tech talk). However, I have discovered that a matte screen is easier on my eyes, and so I'm glad. The keyboard is indeed very nice; the keys are big, and there's just the right amount of ""bounce"" for my taste. There's some odd spacing issues for some keyboard shortcuts, but I assume I'll get used to them.I could care less that it's plastic. It doesn't have a plastic feel, and it is a very nice design. I wish the keyboard could be backlit when needed, but at this price, I won't quibble.I expected it to just be Chrome, but there's a nice files manager if one plugs in a hard drive or thumb drive. There's enough Google apps to do most jobs I need to do. MS Office online is a bit too ""lite"" for me, but I expect I'll manage. I don't use any specialized software for my work.The only serious complaint I have is that Bluetooth doesn't work on speakers right now. Really? I have to plug them in? That's a serious oversight that Google ought to fix asap.But still, this computer is a great deal, and I'm tickled that I didn't spent much money on it. It seems ridiculous to spend $750 more to get a MacBook Air. That's what I'm comparing this to. This computer is light, stylish, easier than heck to use, doesn't use Windows (thank goodness), and has some really lovely OS touches that took this ex-Mac user less than an hour to figure out.If you're looking for a computer to get online with, to bring on trips, and don't use Photoshop, or CAD/CAM, or any other ""serious"" programs, look no further for your next computer. It'll make you feel smart that you saved so much money. Go out and spent the rest of something totally frivolous. Me? I don't need an aluminum chassis machine. This is a tool for the mind, not an automobile.So, with a few problems, 5 stars (easily)! If the screen was better & Google fixed the Bluetooth issue, I'd give it ten stars. Oh yeah, I can't. One last thing: the ports are in the back. It's an odd design choice, but even with that. . .five stars!

4733,"REMEMBER - IT'S CHROME: I recently purchased this product.  I have come to think of it as an item that fits nicely in-between a tablet and a laptop - therefore the perfect twixt device. It is larger than a regular iPad but is much thinner than most netbooks. I am a latent Google Chrome user and this product is designed to work specifically with Chrome. So if you are not familiar with Chrome then you will have a bit of a learning curve. Having been completely immersed in the Microsoft Windows OS world, it takes some getting use to. I am not totally happy with the Chrome layout, but there are too may pluses to using Chrome coupled with the portability of the Samsung Chrome device.CONVENIENCE A PLUS!: Yes you can buy other netbooks and just use Chrome, but they are thick and unfriendly (hate the noisy hot-air venting fans). The Chromebook, on the other hand, is very portable and light with no fan.  There's no overheating and I can sit it on my lap and type without using those funky fake tablet keyboards - and with a larger screen to boot! So typing emails are a breeze!  The storage is nice since Chrome storage is in the cloud and I can download files to my other computer using Chrome. I can use it for hours without giving the battery a second thought. You do get a longer lasting charge if you dim the screen slightly with the convenient dimmer key located as one of the quick-use short-cut keys in the top row of the keyboard. I take this everywhere and my poor old laptop sits off to the side in semi-retirement.  Without all of those start-up software programs and OS to load, this thing comes on-line quick.WIFI WORKS WELL - I had only one problem with not being able to use the wifi at my public library as it kept searching and would not access it. I eventually powered it off and turned it back on - no problem after that.  My wife uses her iPad at a public hotspot and I happily sit across from her gliding around the internet without retyping all of those errors I make when using tablets. The touchpad works well. I plan on adding Witopia VPN in the next several weeks so as to increase security at public sites. I have no need for the 3G model as there are plenty of public hotspots.  The bottom line is I like its light weight, thin design, decent quality and fast sign-on, and no more security suites to keep up with (Chrome takes care of that automatically).NOT A STAND-ALONE COMPUTER...at least as far as downloading and using lots of software. Remember that you cannot add regular software programs to this, that's a trade-off allowing it to be so compact. Most ""computing"" via software-like programs is done via the cloud. There are Google ""apps"" but nothing like the choices you would find on an Apple product, though you do have a fairly good selection at the Chrome store. If you are a heavy MS Office user, I don't think this will work for you, though you can access some MS Office items with the Google Docs app. QuickOffice is rumored to be coming. I haven't tried this out yet. You may want to experiment with Google Chrome on your regular computer before purchasing a Chromebook.  I am, however, a cloud storage convert. I am tired of losing files or having to back-up files.  Chrome does this for you automatically. My Netflix videos work fine with no hanging-up from my home router. But I am sure this is not an ideal entertainment device for gaming or video buffs due to limited storage memory and a small hard drive. It was never intended to be a high-graphics computer. Screen resolution is quite adequate but not a high-def experience. Remember, you will make some sacrifices. So far it has been well worth the drawbacks.SUMMARY: Although, I like the overall sleek design, I will state upfront that I am less happy with the lack of tabletop icons like you get with Windows. There is also my inability (so-far) to permanently display my bookmarks on the side screen, though you can easily bring up the bookmark box or use the bookmark bar. Accessing and saving bookmarks is not intuitive.  But, of course, I am a MS-ingrained user. So still, I give the unit a 5 Star and its operating system the benefit of the doubt and a 4 instead of a 3.  I would rate the unit an overall 4.5 - but since there is no such rating available - I will give it a weak 5 because, even with my difficulty to adjust to the Chrome OS on this unit, I know I will continue to use it and adjust. In fact, I am now using it in my lap while I sit here on my sofa.  It is just too convenient and I am now hooked. You can take it everywhere even in one hand with the screen open and on (though not recommended). I am now also ordering the iPearl mCover Hard Shell Case for 11.6"" Samsung Chromebook (Wi-Fi or 3G) laptop - Black to prevent scratches.  Remember that you have to buy an ethernet adapter to hook up to a wired connection. But overall it is a very portable, convenient, fast, fun, and quite functional unit that is reasonably priced - it's a keeper!ADDED - PRINTING and SKYDRIVE: After a week I decided to set up my printer via Google Cloud. Instructions for set-up were goofy and a bit frustrating. I must reiterate that Google Chrome is not as well designed as MS Windows. But they are getting better. Menus have a basic and simple looking layout (as in cheap-looking design) and are funky to use.  Still...the Chromebook is so small and light and super convenient. I am keeping my eyes open as Google continues to fix and upgrade their Chrome. I would also reiterate that if you are a die-hard MS Office guru - stick with a Windows-enabled device for now.  I am using MS Skydrive for accessing my MS Office docs, so got around that problem. As for the Chromebook - no technical or mechanical problems yet.  Love that l-o-n-g battery - hours and hours! As for my old laptop - it just waits and waits and waits for my return.UPDATE: November 5th, 2014 - I am typing on my Chrome as I write this update. I have read some disappointed/upset reviews. Maybe some got a bad unit. I have had no problems with mine so far. I also purchased a iPearl mCover Hard Shell Case for 11.6"" Samsung Chromebook (Wi-Fi or 3G) laptop - Black which helps protect the cover from scratches and minor bumps. I dropped my Chromebook in the airport about seven months ago and it bent the corner some.  But since there are no moving parts, when I opened it up, it came right on - so still using it. I used it while overseas for six months.  It is great having a light portable unit without a fan running all of the time. Besides the portability, it comes in handy to have the cloud quickly accessible and the longer-than-average battery life (the battery last much longer if you dim the screen slightly).  When I need something bigger than my Google Nexus, especially for typing, I take this instead. I almost feel sorry for those poor chaps lugging around full-sized laptops at the local hotspots. I love mine and I don't know how I got along without it before.  I just hope they continue the development of Chrome and improve on the quality and selection of ""apps"". I think this is a great second machine for business folks.  The Google Apps are not up to the Apple and Microsoft quality. Except for that, I'll use it for a while longer while my old laptop is continues gathering dust on the keys.

The fact that it boots in the blink of an eye made it instantly interesting. I was able to login with my own private google account, instead of the school's guest account and all my settings were there as if I was sitting at home on my desktop. The chicklet keys are pretty much comparable to mac's. The track-pad is large and very responsive, but you have to change your settings to ""fast"" otherwise it takes three full swipes just to get across the screen. With our school's sketchy (and sometimes non-existent) wifi, I was surprised at how fast I was able to load new tabs. The only problem for me was that a) the screen is matte and it makes colors look less vivid and sometimes distorts images and b) Any documents you create must be on google drive, and when you print from the doc app directly the formatting is different from most standard word processors. There are ways to change the formatting, but unless you know specific details, this can be very confusing. Overall... I am considering buying one of these for college since they are light and extremely portable. At such a low cost, if all you want to do is browse the web this is definitely the computer for you.

4737,"I was one of the people who received a CR48 Chromebook when Google ran their pilot program. It was a cool experience, but Chrome OS was so young then. It was just a fullscreen browser. It's come a long way since 2010.Chrome OS is a great operating system once you shake off your perceived need for a ""regular"" operating system. If you are a designer, programmer, artist, gamer, or video editor, you can't use this as your main computer. If you're a regular consumer who browses the web, watches videos, uses social networking sites, chats with friends, and plays the occasional casual game, there's nothing wrong with Chrome OS. Google is even slowly introducing some cool features that can be activated if you're into poking around (in chrome://flags). These features range from multitasking gestures (here now but experimental) and animations to Google Now and notification syncing (not available yet but there is evidence of their existence in the Flags page.Something worth noting is that this particular Chromebook has an ARM processor, like a tablet or smartphone, or Microsoft's Surface RT. More recently, developers have been creating apps for Chrome OS that run on what is called, ""Native Client"" which is basically a local program like what you would install on any other computer. Most of those will not run on this machine. They should run on any Chromebook with an Intel processor, but none of the developers have compiled their software to run on ARM processors.For non-computer geeks and computer science majors: ARM processors communicate in a language that programs written for Intel processors don't ""speak"".I bought one of these Chromebooks without knowing how many native client apps I would actually try to install. Most are games, so it's not the end of the world, but it's a disappointment. The Acer C7 is cheaper but less attractive, has a fan, is thicker, and has about half the battery life of this Samsung model.The Samsung Chromebook is made of very cheap plastic (it's a $250 computer after all) that will scuff immediately if you put it in a backpack with anything else. I put mine in a bag with three children's books from the library and they scuffed the lid pretty badly. Otherwise it's not too flimsy and doesn't feel that cheap. I've seen some Windows laptops with really flimsy cases. The keyboard and touchpad are actually really good for the price too. No complaints there. The keys are spaced adequately and aren't too high or too low for me. The touchpad is responsive and not a pain to use. This Chromebook does have a matte display though, which is a pro or con for you depending on your preferences. I used to be anti-matte displays but I got used to it.As for the operating system, I've grown accustomed to it after a few months and I have no reason to go back to Windows, Mac OS, or a desktop Linux OS. If I had $1300 to spend on a computer, I would absolutely buy the Chromebook Pixel. I'm very happy with the direction Chrome OS is going.

4738,"I'm a writer and I write a lot in different places--the couch, offices, cafes, etc.I needed a laptop with great battery life that was ultralight and compact, yet had keys that are both nice to type with and full size (or near full size).I searched for a long time for the right combination of these traits, and was about to buy a $1800 gleaming, light-as-a-feather beast that had known SSD hang issues when I realized I didn't need to run all my Adobe and sound production apps on the go. I really needed to be able to reliably check my e-mail, surf the web, and do word processing.The Chromebook met my weight, size and battery requirements. And at under $250, it was a lot, lot cheaper than its closest competitor.A couple of things did make me nervous--Google Drive as the only storage space? What if I couldn't connect to Wifi? Where ""were"" the files?I was already a g-mail user, and I have an Android phone, so I already had Google Docs, which, it turns out, is Google Drive. I hadn't liked the lag while typing on Google Docs with slow Wifi, but when my DSL slows down, I can work offline and the wordprocessing is as crisp as on a desktop. There are some buggy aspects to the cursor (it appears a little below my text...), and the lack of a ""DEL"" button was irksome at first. And because I'm constantly backspacing to blot a line, my pinkie sometimes hits the power button, but that just makes the screen contract for the blink of an eye--but I've never accidentally shut it down.So, now, about wordprocessing offline--it works perfectly, saying ""all changes saved offline"" while you're typing, and then the moment you're back online, all the docs you've changed update on Google Drive--obviously, if you want to save your previous draft, just change the file title while you're working. (I've spent my life e-mailing draft versions back and forth to myself to have access to them when I'm not at home). Google Drive, of course, means I have access to my files everywhere, even on my phone--so if I need to e-mail them to a client, I can do that when I'm at the beach.But really, I had no idea how much I would love this computer. I now do all my writing on it. I can't imagine buying a mega monster for thousands of dollars when this has such functionality. GooglePlay for Chrome, which offers apps that run in the Chrome environment, provides all the productivity software you could desire.I'm not a big game player, so I don't know how they do on it, but Netflix and Pandora work perfectly in the browser.

4739,"I'll start off by saying that I am a student at an engineering/tech school. I have a much stronger laptop (16 gb ram, 2.7 gHz i7 processor) for rendering and programming, with the only downside being it sucks up battery and is insanely heavy. I wanted a laptop that I could easily carry around to class or friend's rooms for writing reports or facebook browsing or simply having the resource of the internet available while doing homework (wolframalpha and chegg, to name a few). The Chromebook excels in everything I have asked of it. It boots instantly, the battery lasts longer than I ever need of it, it charges very fast (about 2 hours), and removes all the painful experiences related to other computers. When it is in my backpack it feels as if not even there. My other laptop has a 500gb drive, so I was at first skeptical about such a downgrade. But you really don't need much space and I doubt I'll ever bring this one to its full 16 gigs. I bought it at best buy for 250 and it was worth it in every way. I would not use it as one's only computer, but it is the perfect companion to a desktop or larger, less portable laptop. On average I now boot up my ""real"" laptop twice a week and use the Chromebook for everything else. As a side note, you get used to the small screen and start to enjoy it. I now feel like my 15.4"" laptop is a movie theater screen compared to one's home TV. Overall, this was a great investment to make internet browsing and light document edition a painless experience.

4740,"The Chromebook is the best laptop device I've ever owned. It's not because it's particularly fast or can do everything - it's because it does a range of functions that are suited to travel particularly well and at this price it's practically disposable. I've stopped carrying my 17"" Dell that has a failing battery, weird audio problems and sluggish start-up time - this has a battery like no other, starts in under 2 seconds and is perfect for making calls and working on the go.From the start the unit is integrated into Google so without a Gmail/Google Apps account, you're not going to get very far. But if you use all the Google products, the Chromebook is tailor-made for you. It won't run Microsoft Windows applications or regular desktop programs like Photoshop and it's pretty much locked down to have the user live within a browser. But this is really part of the charm given how much of my work and personal life has moved into Chrome that I rarely notice it doesn't run anything else. It also won't run Skype but given the tragically bad development of Skype in recent years, Google Hangouts offers a much better alternative (with the exception of subscription based international calling).Not being a traditional laptop and with a strong focus on the cloud, there are some things that are a bit different. Multiple users can have accounts on the machine and these are directly integrated with their equivalent Google accounts (no need for different types of access control). Nothing is stored on the machine unless you explicitly download content so in many ways it's safer for work if you lose it since it can be remotely wiped if necessary. Everything is app-driven so when you can't find a feature, searching in the app store is the first place to start - I'd recommend adding the calendar and calculator apps immediately.It's a small device with a smaller keyboard than you might be used to but I've found I can get 80-90 wpm no problem whereas on the Surface tablet keyboard, I'm struggling to get over 40wpm. The battery life is much better than any Windows desktop equivalent and I routinely work 6-7 hours without needing a charge. The screen is bright and clear and the integrated webcam is great for conference calls and Google Hangouts. When travelling, I watch movies on my Chromebook and sometimes take my ChromeCast ($35) to plug into hotel TVs to get a bigger screen. You can also plug in a USB keyboard, mouse and headphones too if necessary.I own pretty much every tablet out there and have found I almost always use my Chromebook instead. It updates itself, it's not virus prone, the wi-fi works great - it's just such an incredibly simple computer that I bought my parents one and even they don't have any questions. I honestly never expected to like it this much (I never had the same love for my Dell Mini) and it works flawlessly for 95% of the work I need to do. Samsung has built a marvelous piece of hardware here even compared with other Chromebooks and for this price it's a must-have for any business traveler, student or even just as an extra screen around the house.

4741,"I really like my Chromebook.I was hesitant when I first bought it. But my old laptop was breaking down on me in the middle of a school semester, and I didn't want to spring for a ""real"" computer (I had a wedding coming up, plus Christmas, plus a honeymoon -- lots of big expenses). I needed something, because most of my classes are either entirely online or they have some online components. And it had to be cheap.So I bought one of these. It didn't take long to adjust to a computer without the capability to install software. Honestly, not being able to install garbage on it really forced me to learn how to be less ""cluttered"" with my electronic devices.I've had the Chromebook for almost a year now. In the end, there's not much that I miss when using this as compared to a real computer. I miss the screenwriting software I had on my old laptop and I sometimes miss the copy of Sim City 4 I had installed on my old laptop. Neither of those 2 things is a huge deal-breaker for me now (and it probably won't be long until there's a viable screenwriting option for Chromebooks anyway).The downside, of course, is how much the Chromebook wants to rely on a constant internet connection. That can be a pain. But, then, my smartphone can act as a Wi-Fi hotspot, so even when internet service is bad at home or when I go somewhere without Wi-Fi, I've been able to use my phone's data plan to scrape by. I take my phone everywhere anyway. I wouldn't use my phone's data plan to waste time watching YouTube videos or anything that would eat through my data in a hurry, but it's not bad for doing some light internet browsing or typing a document in my Google Drive.

4742,"I'm a writer with a desktop PC. I needed a satellite computer that allowed me to write when I'm away from my ""big"" computer which is anchored to a desk in my office. I hesitated to purchase the Samsung Chrome because it doesn't come installed with Word and I wondered how useful that would be. The price and some reviews I'd read by other writers convinced me to take a chance. I am very happy I did.Pros for a writer:- I can take my Chrome to any room in the house and write.- I can take my Chrome to a coffee shop or bookstore with wifi and write there.- Using a feature of Google, I can actually connect my Chrome to my ""big"" computer and use all the programs there (Word, etc.) Downside: the screen on the Chrome miniaturizes the remote hookup screens, so they are not all that user friendly. But, in a pinch, they *are* accessible.)- Like the Kindle Fire and the iPad, the Chrome (don't ask me why) seems to be virus-resistant (without requiring the added expense of anti-virus software). Because of this, I use the Chrome to surf the Web and use my ""big"" PC to create documents.Cons:- I don't have Word installed. However, I use the workaround described below - which I find works very well.Workaround: I use Evernote.com to compose chunks of text. I then copy and paste these into my ""big"" PC's Word program. I do have to tweak the pasted text a bit but I don't mind that. The benefit of being able to sit comfortably wherever I please to compose my work outweighs the minor issues for me.I'm very pleased with this gizmo. For the price, it is a very good solution to a writer's need to be portable. FYI, I do have an iPad also - and I like it very much but not for writing. Typing on glass is not appealing to me; the Chrome's keyboard is a much better option.

4743,"I've been a Linux user and system administrator for a long time now, and I was getting tired of lugging around a 7+lb Dell Precision M4600, Intel Core i7 - 2960XM - 2.7GHz, 32GB Ram 750GB Hard Drive, 15.6"", Webcam, Touch Screen, 9 Cell Battery + 3 Year Warranty to meetings (don't get me wrong, I need the power of the M4600 regularly) and around the corridors at work. I heard about the Series 3 Chromebook update, and swung by my local big box retailer to pick one up and see what it was capable of.The CPU in this thing is less powerful than the CPU in my smartphone, and it's got less RAM. It's only been three days, and I'm logged into the corporate VPN, SSH sessions are active to the servers I'm working on, and I've got Spotify leaking out my headphones. Admittedly, I had to enable Developer mode to get the Cisco VPN client installed, since there's not a supported AnyConnect client for Chrome OS yet, but I wanted more Linux features anyway for work. Netflix still works, HBO Go still works, color me impressed.I own a Sony Xperia Z SGP311U1/B 10.1-Inch 16GB Tablet and I feel more concerned hauling that thing around, and I'm less productive on it. With the Chromebook's full keyboard, I can code to my little heart's content all the livelong day. I can touch-type notes in meetings instead of having to eyeball the touchscreen to make sure I'm poking the right screen region (or without the bother of carrying a bluetooth keyboard).The last time I was this happy hauling a computer around was with the Dell Mini 9, and the keyboard on that thing was so tiny it hurt my wrists to type on it after an hour. The Chromebook's keyboard is roughly the same size as the Apple Wireless Keyboard MC184LL/B, and although it doesn't have the same soft chiclet keys, the keyboard is quite responsive and natural to use.A note on utility: I am recommending that my parents replace their desktop and kitchen notebook with Series 3 Chromebooks (or maybe Series 5 after the update). With SkyDrive, they can have the familiar Microsoft Office experiences through the web interface, and everything else is already accessible through the Chrome browser. My mother preferred the weight of the Chromebook to the weight of her 4th gen iPad, and liked that she could type using the familiar keyboard. I handed the Chromebook after a factory reset with no instructions and she was browsing within 5 minutes, using all the sites she uses with her iPhone, iPad, and desktop. They don't do anything intensive enough that they'd need anything more powerful than the ARM chip, and if there was a scenario where full x86 compatibility was required, the Series 5 is also reasonable. The Series 3 is just so astoundingly portable, though, that I am happy to move all my processor-intensive work to another machine, maybe even using Chrome Remote Desktop to the M4600 to run some of the Enterprise applications if our Security folks decide to allow that. Either way, I am quite pleased with the Series 3.If you are considering one, I'd recommend just purchasing it. It's cheap enough that you don't have to baby it, it's a breeze to set up multiple users if you want to hand it around, and could easily serve as the primary computer for at least 85% of the people I know.

4744,"I purchased my Chromebook back in November, and while it is not a substitute for a traditional computer, I have found it invaluable and a great compliment to my desktop PC and smartphone. When I bought it, I imagined it as a computer I could use for travel and at work to replace my aging laptop. First, the battery life is wonderful. I don't even bother bringing the charger with me to work.The computer connects to the internet fast and easy, and initial setup was a breeze. Since I already had a Google account, everything synced right up - all my files, email, docs, blogs, ect was right there waiting for me. My next step was to set up some apps. These are not traditional apps as you would find on a phone or table, but more like links to a web page. Thats fine, and it really did not make a difference. Since I use Chrome on all my computers, everything again sync'd right up. This computer serves many purposes for me - web surfing checking email, and even watching movies and online content. It boots up fast and is ready to go in seconds.Of course, there are drawbacks. First, it's not a traditional computer. So no programs, CD drives, Microsoft office or any of that stuff. Second, Flash support needs to improve; not every web page is 100% supported. And last, if you have a lot of tabs open, it slows down, but all computers would do that.Who would best benefit from a Chromebook? Honestly, I think in someway everyone could. It's great for kids, students, travelers, bloggers, and business. I don't think it is suited for web content designers and graphic designers, but short of that I have found many uses for both work and play. For $249, how can you go wrong? I recently sold all my Apple stuff and made the move to Android for mobile (with a Samsung phone and Asus tablet) and a  Windows 8 touch PC. The Chromebook completes my transformation and compliments it well.I have not found the need to replace my laptop, and I enjoy the portability and quickness of the Chromebook. It's money well spent.

I have been very disappointed that you can not use any word documents not from Google and that it will not support Skype. Their response is to use our products, but we already have everything set up in Skype and documents from previous computers and from work and don't particularly want to move everything to Google and tell all our friends to change too. Apple used to be bad like this, but they learned that they needed to play nicely!

I can't start up without a pin now, and I can't get to my Frontier email and I can't print even though it worked when it was new.  Did it change because I don't use it enough?

Received it after about 10 days of wait.I love this machine as a pick-it-up-and-browse from anywhere in the house machine. I'm a heavy user of the google ecosystem, and that only adds to the usability of this little chromebook. For someone like me who uses a lot of web based products, or content (Google docs, Evernote, picasa, news sites, youtube, Google Maps, wikipedia, Wolfram Alpha...), all you need is a machine that has a good browser. And this one has the ultra-fast and nimble Chrome. Since I already use Chrome as the default browser from my Linux, Windows and Mac machines... and even from my Android phone, chromebook use feels like a very familiar environment.Tablets have their use, but for me, they are not ideal for extended news reading, or watching a video, for example. One has to hold them by hand. This chromebook can be set on a pillow, or on the lap comfortably. I'm writing this review from the chromebook, and I've been using this thing for the last 2 hours and it is barely warm to the touch.Redeeming 100gb of Google Drive space offer is simple. Just launch the google drive icon and you will be prompted to redeem the offer. Once you claim the 100gb, the next owner of the chromebook will not get the 100gb. Also, google claims that if you return the chromebook, the 100gb of space will be revoked.I easily changed the touchpad settings to mimic the MacBook air type swiping action. All my chrome bookmarks got imported into the chromebook right away.We have a MacBook Air at home, along with two windows based laptops and a few desktop machines.  I already am using this machine for all of my in-home mobile use.  This is a great sidekick for most of my non work related stuff.  However, I do use Microsoft Office apps for certain things, as also some multimedia software as a hobby. And for those, I still definitely need my dual monitor desktop, with all the extra pixels to enhance productivity. For all my research and work needs, a fully fledged laptop or a dual monitor desktop is indispensable; This chromebook just fills a different, but very important need and it does it admirably well.Looks good.

No Netflix support yet on  this Chromebook, though I suspect that support will come soon.UPDATE Nov 4:After two days of use, I still have extremely positive feedback about this machine.  Outside my home office, this is now my goto machine. I'm barely using my tablets now.I quickly needed to figure out two things: CAPS Lock and Page Up and Page Down operations, since the keyboard does not have dedicated keys for these.  Instead of a CAPS lock key, the chromebook has a ""Search"" key at that location. To activate CAPS lock, one has to press <Alt><Search> keys. To deactivate, pressing either <Alt> or <Shift> keys will suffice. For Page Up/down actions, press <Alt><Up-arrow-key> or <Alt><Down-arrow-key>.Search for ""chromeos shortcuts"" on google, and one of the top pages will be a nicely laid out Google help page with a number of shortcuts.Another point of interest: Multiple usersBy default, Chromebook will allow anyone with a gmail address to login, though the very first gmail address that logs in will become the ""owner"".  Any user that logs in to the Chromebook, can use the Google offline storage drive. This will not conflict with other users.  Chromebook also allows a simple ""Guest login"".  Someone who logs into the chromebook can login as a guest using his or her google id. They can browse the net, check their email, etc, but will not be able to use their google drive in offline mode.Now, the ""owner"" can also limit which ""users"" are permitted to use the chromebook, by typing in a ""whitelist"" of google ids in a Settings field.  I setup my chromebook to allow my family members to login as regular users. This way, they can access their google drive space in offline mode as well.  Any visitors to our house who want to borrow the machine for a bit can login in the Guest mode.I tried Google Hangout yesterday. Works very well. There was one point where the person on the other send thought I muted my microphone, while I did not. We could not reproduce that scenario again. I also turned off my Wirelss router and tried to login to the chromebook. I was successful. I could access offline files, and modify them. I was also able to create an Google Doc in the offline mode.  Once I turned on my Wireless router, my offline changes immediately got synced to the Cloud Google drive storage. I checked this from another PC right after I switched on the WiFi router. All this is what I expected, but I wanted to make sure that it works that way. I'm happy it did.  This machine is going to be a keeper.Yes, the screen quality is not as awesome as that of the MacBook Air.  But, it is quite adequate for the purposes I mentioned and I'm really enjoying the experience so far.<Ctrl><Shift><L> quickly locks the screen if you need to leave your chromebook in a hurry.

4748,"UPDATE OCTOBER 15, 2014Have been using the Samsung Chromebook now for over a year and a half, and still LOVE IT!  Have to give it 5 stars.Some background:Decided to go to the Chromebook, and at the time (March 2013) this Samsung was the best solution.  I have never regretted the decision.  I love the thin client concept...I store most everything in OneDrive, since that's what is needed for some of my clients, and easier to develop documents for students and classes.  The Chromebook is fast, exceptionally light, easy to use, and has great battery life.  Have had absolutely no problems with it...of course, I take care of it, am careful with the screen and charging pin, etc.  Have had no problems with the amount of storage since I store everything in the cloud...if I create a doc, I upload it to my OneDrive, and delete it from the onboard SSD.  I store my music on Google drive, and can access it anytime.I have switched my other computers away from Windows and now use Linux (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS).  I have loaded Ubuntu with XFCE onto the Chromebook using Crouton...it's now a full-fledged laptop...I can do anything with my Chromebook I could do with any of my other computers.  Ubuntu on the Chromebook runs fast, is stable, and a great tool.  Only con is it uses battery power a little quicker than when I just stay with ChromeOS.At the time I paid $250 for the Chromebook...best $250 I ever spent.  I still highly recommend the Samsung Chromebook.******************************************************************************************************************May 18, 2013Purchased the Samsung Chromebook several months ago, and extremely happy with it.  I was looking for something to replace a Dell netbook, and did a LOT of research and thinking.  Went to Best Buy several times to play with it, try it out, see how it felt.  There's been lots of reviews on the hardware and software...this review will be primarily from a user standpoint, how it's used.Some background:  I want something light, easy to use and carry, and safe from viruses.  I have an older laptop I use as a desktop in my home office, a netbook, an iPad, a pretty decent desktop at work and a nice one in my wife's office.  Been working with technology for years...early PC adopter, early Mac user, and everything in between and since.  I do consistent backups of all files to an external hard drive.  I decided last year to begin ""living"" in the cloud...why keep things local when it can be put on a server and be able to get to anything anytime...started doing a second backup of all my files to several Skydrive accounts.  I don't do any gaming, and am not a NetFlix junkie.  The iPad is OK for consuming information...don't like it for creating or editing documents...I prefer a regular keyboard.  To me, computers are tools.I teach at a local university, using PowerPoint for classes, Word for documents.  I use online versions of my textbooks, connecting to the publisher's website, highlighting, putting in notes.  It is SO easy to use web versions of Word and PPT to make any quick and dirty changes and create new docs (I prefer the web versions of MS Docs vs. Google Docs).  I can go to the classroom and, using the computer at the teaching station, pull up and display any and all of the documents I need.  If I need something more powerful than the web versions, I can connect to my main computer(s) via Chrome Remote app (have all of them accessible), do what I need, upload the document, and I'm ready to go.  I can access both of the course management systems at the university (LiveText, Blackboard), grade papers, give feedback, etc.Printing is easy...with each of my computers set up, I can print on my black and white laser or my color inkjet. There is web software for basically anything else I need to do outside of the typical.  If I'm someplace without wifi (rarely), I just turn on the Personal Hotspot on my iPhone and connect.  If I receive a document I want to save directly to any of my cloud accounts, I use the attachments.me extension.In sum, everything others have said; easy to use, great keyboard and keypad, decent screen (bigger than my netbook), relatively fast, great boot-up time, super battery life.  Only thing I'm concerned about is the small connecting pin for the power pack...I can see if one isn't careful, it could be broken off relatively easily.Overall great tool. I highly recommend the Chromebook as long as the user knows what it's all about.**************************************************************************************************

4749,"Wow, they're still selling this model? I have had it since 2012.  I use it on almost  a daily basis for internet surfing,  watching movies, and working on spreadsheets (via Microsoft OneDrive and Google Drive).  It gets the job done, though it can be somewhat slow when multiple tabs are open.  Initially, I thought that reliance on Chrome OS  would be a big issue (i.e., very little access to Windows programs), as would the very limited internal storage and the need to rely on cloud-based storage.  In practice, however, these did not prove to be major limitations for the core functions of this machine. For me, a big drawback is the tinny speakers.  The Samsung Chromebook would be far more functional if I could actually listen to music on it without resorting to headphones.  This does detract from the movie watching experience, though movies are listenable.  In addition, the limitations of the processor prevent the Chromebook from being useful in doing things like processing and cataloging photos or in monitoring a lot of video- or imagery-intensive internet tabs simultaneously.  That said, the Chromebook has done an acceptable job in doing 80% of what I want to do with a computer.  It has been a cost-effective choice as a second computer.  The main problem now, however, is that it is outdated. You're likely to be much better off spending a few dollars more on a Chromebook that has a Microsoft processor (compared to which the Samsung Exynos processor in my  2012 Chromebook is a laggard) and has 4mb of RAM (this can make a big difference; my Chromebook only has 2mb.)

4750,"Overall I really love my Chromebook. I'm very familiar with Chrome and use Google's products daily, so it was easy to adopt to. The keyboard is actually much better than I expected. Very comfortable and responsive. I like the ease of use overall and think it was money well spent.The browser itself has been buggy, which is surprising. I use Chrome all the time without any problems. So why would the browser be buggy on its own native OS? If nothing else, I'd expect it to be better.To give you an example, sometimes Google Docs time out and a blank dialog box pops up and hovers over the page without any way to close it. (A dialog box is the alert you get on your computer, usually requiring you to click OK or Cancel.) I haven't figured out what's causing that bug. I opened the same docs on my desktop in Chrome and there were no problems. Sometimes pages like Facebook hang, won't reload, or just won't work at all. I can open the same page on my computer and it's fine.Some people have noted the screen brightness. Yes, it is a bit washed out and hard to read. I turned it up to maximum brightness, which helped, but it still feels like there is a haze over it. Like it's at 90% and could stand to be just a little crisper.Oh well. The computer itself is fast, responsive, lightweight, and great to type on. I'll pick my battles. I would recommend the Chromebook to others, so long as they do realize it's not intended to be a full fledged computer. As long as you have realistic expectations, and already love the Chrome/Google suite of products, I think you'll be very happy with it.NOTE 11/10/12 - The video playback is terrible. Not sure if that's a software issue or hardware. It lags, stutters, and jumps. I removed one star for that, given the fact that I've been able to play video on even my oldest, most deprecate laptops. I still love the Chromebook overall though.NOTE 11/11/12 - The problems with my Chromebook got consistently worse with use since I bought it on 11/08. Finally I wiped everything off it and reset the ChromeOS. It seems to have fixed things. I'm going to play with it a little more just to confirm, and then I will revise my review to be accurate.

4751,"I am very disappointed with the chromebook.  I was hoping to replace my laptop computer, but so far this device cannot stream netflix or amazon videos.  I love it otherwise, it is small and light and boots up so quickly.  I was also hoping to use it to transfer pictures from my camera to the cloud drive, but this is either impossible or difficult to figure out - I spent a few hours trying the other night and was unsuccessful.

So, for what it's worth, here are some things I've learned about the Samsung Chromebook, either by conducting my own experiments or by finding the info in the nether regions of the internet...1.  Bluetooth:  Yes, just as advertised, you CAN pair the Chromebook up to a Bluetooth keyboard or mouse.  You CANNOT at this time, however, pair it up to a Bluetooth audio device.  This fact is not very well publicized and, the first day I was goofing around with the Chromebook, I couldn't understand why it would pair up to my iHome iDM8 bluetooth speaker for about two seconds, and then just as quickly unpair again.This issue (#204431) has been fixed, and when the Chromebook automatically updates to stable Chrome OS milestone/release 28, Bluetooth audio should be enabled.  Stable release/milestone 27 came out on 23 May 2013.  This means that, since stable versions of Chrome OS are released roughly every three months, stable milestone/release 28 should be available by about 23 August 2013.In the meantime, if you want to switch to the beta or unstable developer release/milestone of Chrome OS to see if bluetooth audio works on your Chromebook, you can do this by doing the following:a)  click on the bottom right hand side of the screen where the time, wifi signal, etc. are shown.b)  click on ""settings""c)  click on ""help""d)  click on ""more info"".  (Fyi:  this screen also shows you the release/milestone of Chrome OS you are currently running...)e)  under ""channel"", click on the release of Chrome OS you want to use (Stable, Beta, or Dev-Unstable)2.  Which formats are the USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 ports on the Chromebook capable of reading?  I could find absolutely no information anywhere on the internet about this topic, so I had to do my own testing to find the answer.  Using an ADATA 16GB USB 3.0 flash drive for the test, I formatted the flash drive to FAT32, NTFS, and Ext3/Ext4.  The Samsung Chromebook was able to read the flash drive formatted to each of these formats with no problem.  I also plugged an RCA MP3 player formatted to FAT16 into the Chromebook's USB 2.0 port, and it was able to read the format and all of the mp3 files on the device flawlessly.3.  Video Playback:  According to the manual, the Chromebook can only play MP4 video files.  However, as unlikely as it would seem, quite a few people on the internet have mentioned that they were able to take MKV video files, simply change the file extension to MP4, and then play the files on their Chromebook.Here's what I found to be true, at least as far as my particular Chromebook goes:I used the movie ""Branded"" and transcoded it to MKV, codec H.264, 1690Kbps variable Bitrate, AAC/165Kbps audio, 852 x 480 resolution.  I then formatted the ADATA 16GB USB 3.0 flash drive to NTFS and copied the transcoded movie onto it.  The Chromebook was unable to play the file.  I then changed the file extension to MP4 and tried to play it again.  Once again, the Chromebook was unable to play the file.  I then transcoded the movie to MP4 and tried to play it.  The Chromebook was able to play that file with no problem.Bottom line here:  My Chromebook can only play video files which have been fully transcoded to MP4 format.4.  Video Playback from Google Drive:  Uploaded the transcoded MP4 copy of ""Branded"" to Google Drive.  The Chromebook was able to play the file via Google Drive Viewer with no problems.5.  Google Cloud Print:  There are two ways to print from this Chromebook.  The first is to buy a cloud-ready printer.  I don't know much about these printers, but it looks like the cheapest ones run about $60.  The other way is to use another computer with Google Chrome Browser installed on it.  I tried this method, and was (no joke) able to set up Google Cloud Print and print a test page from my Chromebook in under two minutes.The details:  My desktop computer dual-boots Windows 8 and Ubuntu 13.04 operating systems.  It has two printers hooked up to it, an HP Deskjet 3521 and a Brother HL-2230.  Although it specifies in the Chromebook instructions that you must use a Mac or Windows PC, I set up Google Cloud Print using Ubuntu with no difficulty, and was able to print on both printers.Here are the steps for setting up Google Cloud Print:a)  Open the Google Chrome browserb) Click on the little icon at the top right-hand side of the screen that has three little lines on it.c) Click on ""settings""d) Scroll all the way down and click on ""Show Advanced Settings""e) Click on ""Google Cloud Print""f)  Sign in to your Google accountg)  Click on ""Add Printers""h)  Click on ""Add All Printers""Remember, whenever you print using this method, your other computer needs to be on (not asleep or hibernating...).6.  Streaming Video:  Tried streaming the pilot episode of ""Breaking Bad"" via Netflix, Amazon Video and Google Play Movies.  It looked great on Netflix and Amazon Video but, strangely, it stopped and buffered so often on Google Play Movies that it was not watchable.  I tried this several times over the course of a couple of days and got the same results each time.7.  ODF documents (.ODT, .ODS, .ODP):  Installed OpenDocument Reader from the Chrome Web Store and was able to view all my LibreOffice ODF documents, both the downloaded ones and the ones stored on Google Drive and Dropbox.  This is a read-only feature, though.  If you want to edit one of these documents, you'll need to upload it to Google Drive and make sure that you have enabled ""Convert uploaded files to Google Docs format"" in Google Drive settings.  Alternatively, you can use the ""LibreOffice on rollApp"" app from the Chrome Web Store.  The app seems to work pretty well.8.  How to see the file size of a file on Google Drive after you've uploaded it:On Google Drive, in the upper right-hand side of the screen, click on ""sort"", then click on ""quota used"".9.  Other observations:a)  Kindle Cloud Reader works great on the Chromebook; and, yes, you can download Kindle ebooks for offline reading.b)  You get 100GB of cloud storage for two years for free on Google Drive when you buy a Chromebook.  The two years doesn't necessarily start the day you buy the Chromebook.  It starts the day you sign up for the 100GB.  When the two years are up, you will not lose the stuff you uploaded to Google Drive.  You'll always be able to access your data even after the two years are up.  You just won't be able to add any more data to Google Drive unless you choose to buy more storage.c)  Downloading music from both Google Play and Amazon onto the Chromebook is very easy, and it's almost instantaneous. (Seems to be much faster than downloading to Windows PC or Android tablet...)d)  How to turn on Caps Lock:  Alt-Searche)  This Chromebook has a matte screen instead of a glossy screen.  This means that there is almost no glare, but the picture might not look quite as vivid as it would on a glossy screen.  Personally, I'd prefer the matte screen on this thing over the glossy screen on my Windows 8 Laptop any day...f)  The Chromebook has a pre-installed file manager that is just called ""files"".  It usually automatically opens when you insert a drive into one of the USB ports.  You can also bring it up by selecting the ""files"" icon in the Chromebook's app manager.  ""Files"" works fine, but it would be nice if there were other file managers, such as Android's ES File Explorer or XPlorer, available for the Chromebook.  It would also be nice if there were media player apps available for it that could play MKV video files.  We're still in the early days of Chrome OS development, so it wouldn't be surprising at all if apps such as these become available in the near future.g) Yes, the battery is supposed to be easily replaceable if you're willing to take the bottom cover off by removing a few screws.9.  Things I'd like to know about the device, but haven't had a chance to research yet:a)  How fast can the Chromebook write to a USB 3.0 drive?b)  I know you can't use a portable external hard drive with it, but can you use an external desktop hard drive with its own power supply with the Samsung Chromebook?c)  Can you use an external DVD USB drive with it?I'll update this review if/when I find the answers to these questions or find out any other interesting tidbits of information about this Chromebook...Hope the above information has helped you in some way.  Enjoy your Chromebook.  Imho, It's well worth the $250.Update:  Plugged my 120GB WD USB 2.0 portable external hard drive into it.  Was surprised when the Chromebook recognized the drive and played audio/video files from it with no problems. Thanks to Dr. Mark Tweedie for replying to let me know that his Chromebook could recognize his Seagate external hard drive...

4753,"I'm sold on Chromebooks.  I recently picked one of these up, and despite being an 'old' model it works perfectly fine.  What i use it for is juggling social media for a company, and I love how I can have all of the accounts, a dashboard, and music playing all at the same time with no performance issues.  New apps are being introduced all the time that offer offline access.  The OS updates itself, which is great because I just want to be able to turn things on and go.  Styling is attractive  nothing objectionable and the silver makes it look more expensive than it actually is. Heavy use has consistently given me 6+ hours of battery life.  It's lightweight and so easy to carry around.  I was concerned that the screen would be too small but I've never had that be a problem.  It cold boots in under 10 seconds and you're connected and ready to work.Demerits are few - screen quality could be better but honestly what do you expect at this price range?  And if you're into tinkering the ram and ssd are not upgradable in this model.Bottom line - unless you use some unique, high end app (AutoCAD, Adobe Creative Suite products, Final Cut) or have to have the fruit symbol on the cover this will handle everything that you need it to handle.  I can't think of a better option for similar money.

4754,"I bought my chromebook at Best Buy just incase I needed to return it. I use google everything but was not sold that this device could satisfy my needs. The first few days I was pretty convinced that I was going to need to take this chromebook back. I then learned a few tricks about the OS that I liked and remembered that this is afterall a $250 laptop.I was interested in this particular model because it runs an ARM cpu and that should promise better battery life. Furthermore, as Ubuntu (linux distro) keeps pushing into the phone market Linux support for ARM is getting stronger everyday. In fact, if wanted this ""chromebook"" will run Ubuntu 13.04, I have done it and it works remarkably well.At first I wanted to compare this device to my nexus 4 or $3000 gaming computer. Neither of which is a fair comparison and led to my immediate dissatisfaction with the device.I broke out my old Asus EEE PC netbook and decided to compare against that. The EEE PC never satisfied my needs in regards to battery life and overall functionality; particularly it had WiFi issues at my University and would rarely go more than 3 hours between charges. I also had to shut it off to put it in my bag and thus take a minute or so booting back up at the beginning of every class.This chromebook appears to easily go its advertised 6.5 hours. I would estimate I am getting about 7 to 8 hours per full charge actually. The display is adequate but you won't be watching movies with friends or doing any work outside. The screen is a matte finish which to me is ideal for its application. The device produces very little heat, could even just be heat trapped from my own body when using it on my lap, thus I have no issues closing it and throwing it in a book bag. Next, even if I did shut it down, this thing is reliably booting up in just under 10 seconds.Obviously this is not my gaming computer or even nexus 4, I say that because most of everything you can do on it is ran from the chrome web browser. As mentioned before I am an avid user of Google products, so the transition to google docs, google calendar, etc was not difficult or foreign to me.So what changed. Well first knowing I can use Ubuntu if I want and that it runs better than it did on my EEE PC (direct comparison). Secondly learning how to open webapps in a way that tricks me into thinking its a native app. I know this is silly but I don't like the idea of everything I open being a tab in chrome. You can ""right click"" and change the way ""apps"" open and one such way is to open in a window. For me this makes for a cleaner user experience.The software is constantly being updated and is completely seamless to the user. I have ""wiped the device"" a few times now and logging back in everything is just as you left it minus files locally stored, welcome to the cloud. Early versions of the software apparently had issues with the major video streaming services. I have used netflix, hulu, youtube, and amazon with no issues.Pros-Price-Battery Life-Seamless user experience-Option of Ubuntu as an OS-Weight-Bluetooth Audio A2DP support in newest Beta releaseCons-Few native apps (Gotten better since Google I/O 2013 and introduction of packaged apps)-lack of bluetooth audio (fixed as of May 24, 2013 on Beta channel)After a week with this laptop I am pretty sure I will be keeping it. It is great if you keep your expectations realistic. I would say its most ideal use is as a college student's note taking laptop or a second computer in a household.

4755,"As many before me have already stated, Chromebook is an awesome addition to your tech arsenal.  I think the people that have been disappointed are the ones that do not fully understand the features of Chromebook and what it is mean to do/not meant to do.  It's all about expectations!I got Chromebook specifically for graduate school.  My husband just picked one up for college. We both already have access to a PC with Microsoft Office through our gaming laptops and also available for use at school and the local library.  For us, this is a supplementary device that we both plan to use specifically for note-taking, internet browsing, school email to communicate with professors and classmates, accessing course materials, reading and researching PDF articles, and word processing via Google Drive.Chromebook might be the right device for you IF you meet one or more of the following:- low or basic tech needs - internet browsing, use of online apps- already using Google products such as Gmail/familiarity with their products- basic use of word processing, spreadsheets, presentations- you will be in an area with free wifi whenever you plan to use this device (home, school, library, coffee shop, etc.)- you plan for Chromebook to be a supplementary or secondary device (read: you already have a computer or access to a computer at home)- you are open minded and willing to try new things!Chromebook is 2.4 pounds, has approximately 6 hours of battery life, and is fun and easy to use.  It is smaller than my clipboard and fits in my backpack right between my notebooks and textbooks.  The weight, long battery life, and quick boot and shutdown time (seriously, it is up and running in SECONDS) make this an awesome computer for students.Although Chromebook is extremely portable, it is not necessarily a good fit for a frequent traveler that does not have access to reliable wifi.  Nor is it a good fit for someone that actually NEEDS to run the full suite of Microsoft Office or other programs.  It is not a gaming laptop.  Let's be honest though, most people just use computers for email, web browsing, and visiting various social media sites.  If that sounds like you then I think you should give Chromebook a try!If you are a student, I highly recommend Chromebook as your primary machine for school.  If you really are worried about the fact that you will not have access to MS office or other specific programs then I recommend that you check with your school library or computer lab to see if the programs are available there.  If so then I wouldn't hesitate to pick up Chromebook.Once you start using Chromebook you will fall in love.

4758,"First thing this thing is purpose built to do 1 thing, get you on the Internet. Expecting it to do anything else and your expecting to much. Yes it may play SOME video file types and audio but it is hardly built for that and a normal machine with VLC or some other video player will do the job vastly better. Your limited to using online services to do anything, but have offline Google Docs/Scratchpad and a couple other things. There is the 2 years worth of 100gb online storage, which is good for backing up files online so you can quickly access them on the go since your 16gb HD will get filled quickly if you try to use it. I personally just use the 100gb free storage for backing up files off site.If your buying this with the expectation of using the 100gb of online storage as if it was a hard drive, don't. It's best used as a backup of your data and to quickly upload your newly made files in Google Docs and such so you can access it anywhere with an Internet connection. As trying to rely on an Internet connection to get the data isn't a good way to go about it, and sometimes it has taken a few minutes for things to show up in the Google Drive folder on the laptop itself. Which trust me put me into a bit of a panic after I wrote a 4 page essay and it wasn't appearing when I needed to submit it in a few hours. After 10min or so it finally appeared. This is one of the small bugs or shortcomings I found with the OS, there were 1-2 other bugs I found after I thoroughly put it through it paces in the last few weeks. May sound like a lot, but honestly I find more on my primary Win 7 desktop machine in the same time frame, the difference is that I have other options in terms of programs on the Windows machine so I can ignore it. Where as with this I have to work with it.What everyone says is true the boot time is incredibly fast. Never felt the need to time it myself. It will get your online so you can check emails/facebook/etc. With me I personally bought it for school, which means I will end up using Google docs for notes and writing assignment (than putting it into a real word processor before submitting, so I can use spelling/grammar check). As well and researching assignments all of which this thing will do quite well.What this laptop is though is the exact definition of K.I.S.S (Keep It Short and Simple). It is a stripped down OS with cheap quality hardware which was selected to give the best user experience, not benchmark experience. The arm A15 1.7ghz dual core is more than capable of handling all tasks this was designed for (Internet) and the SSD provides a quick boot experience, quality keyboard/touchpad and overall build quality. The only grip here is with the screen with bad viewing angels, and how the light sensor keeps adjusting the screen too much based on the light condition.The OS itself is one of the things I like the most. It is highly sandboxed with how the OS was designed, with updates pushed silently in the background. And all the user data is encrypted with 128bit encryption, and quite a bit of other encryption found in various other places in the OS using the TPM. Something I won't go into as it's a good read if you look into it, and some of it goes over my head so I'd rather not spread false information. For me the encryption part is quite important as it is a laptop and will be used on the go and having it lost/stolen will just mean I lose the device itself and not half to worry about personal information being compromised. Assuming it is powered down, or signed off not just a locked screen (and you used a good strong password). The OS also has a ""Self Healing"" which I hear some people refer to it as, when the computer turns on it checks against a known good version of itself to check for tampering and if there is any tampering it will use that instead of the tampered version.The biggest strength this laptop has is also it's weakness. It is built with simplicity in mind. It carries the mentality of ""If it works it works, if it doesn't it doesn't"" there are pretty much no workarounds to that (K.I.S.S as I referred to it earlier). Where as with a Window or ""real"" Linux based machine there is almost always a workaround you can do to get the job done. Where as with this if something doesn't work your out of luck, your not given the ability to install any actual programs or any real control in the computer settings. The amount of control in the computer settings is what you find in the Chrome Browser and a few other small settings which I wouldn't mind someone computer illiterate play with (AKA no real ability to change anything). But you do have the option to change the ""search key"" back to ""caps lock"" if you choose to do so. Though personally I found more use for the search key as it brings up the minimized taskbar and will search the Internet and various other things for you.In short this laptop is made to be used on the Internet, nothing more nothing less. If you want a laptop to do basic web browsing on the cheap this is for you. If you want something to write up paper and do web browsing, you can do that to. But I highly recommend loading up what you write into a real word processor so you can take advantage of spelling/grammar check and all the other features Google Docs doesn't provide or provide a good enough version of as I find it quite basic. In terms of buying this for school, I find it would be quite good for that so far from playing with it for the last several weeks though I haven't had a chance to try it out in class myself yet. As I already put several notes into Google docs so far, and have had great battery life with this. You can easily make it through any class without charging.And to answer your question you may be asking yourself. Yes it's a great little laptop and worth buying IF you can manage to work within it's limitations. If you want to know if you can, install chrome on your computer and try to use nothing but that and Google docs, Google drive, and other Google web based programs for a day or two. The rest of the OS is quite simple to learn, it took me less than 10min to figure out almost everything I could do with it due to having experience with Chrome Browser. It also has chrome remote access so you can remote access your Windows based machine to do quick amount of real work while on the go, but it isn't something I rely on if you can.

4759,"Just bought this on 3/30 and I'm already really impressed with it's features.  Even though it has no moving parts and needs internet access for 98% of what it does, it's still amazingly full featured.  I was initially hesitant about buying this, thinking that ""it won't function without the internet?  WTH!""  but once I got to playing around with it and thought more about it, I realized that there was really not an occasion where I was completely without internet access - either because I was at home or I could tether to my cellphone.The apps are simply shortcuts that open a webpage instead of being physically installed on the machine and they can be obtained through the Chrome Store.  Regular Android apps will not work on this!  The 11.6"" screen is super bright if you have the brightness all the way up, but that runs the battery down fast.  The specs state you can get between 6 and 7 hours of battery life from this, but yesterday after I brought it home, I used it heavily for 5 solid hours before I needed to plug it up (videos, streaming music, brightness 100%, adding apps) so I'm thinking that the 6-7 hour estimate is pretty accurate.  The keyboard is pretty nice for what some would describe as ""budget'.  It's responsive and the keys are not stiff like I've heard others say.  The webcam leaves a little to be desired.  It's super laggy and trying to record myself on a video was like watching one of those Sunday afternoon kung-fu movies where the subtitles don't match the lips.  I can attach my flash drive and watch movies on it via the embedded movie player, but if you let the movie pause for too long the chromebook sleeps and then you can't get the movie to come back one without taking out the flash drive and then reinserting it to find the movie.  Must be a way around that.  There's a slot to put in a regular SD card, which is great because I take lots of pictures on my Canon T2i, so that's a nice way to check out new pics on a bigger screen and edit or whatever.  Startup is quick and shutdown is quick.  Hold the power button down for four seconds to shut down and that's it.  Turning it back on is just as fast since there's only a SSD hard drive and no moving parts.This is ideal to travel with.  Just tether it to your phone so you can be sure to get a safe WiFi connection.  It's light and small and if you're a big Google user, then all your stuff is available when you want it.  You can video chat with people on Hangouts or Skype, or stream some music or maybe a movie.  It even asks for a password when you boot up!  Best of all, there's no OS mess to constantly worry about updating because Google OS will update itself.  This little device will take care of itself.  The only thing you need to do is have fun with it, because it's all kinds of fun contained in one little package (no, I don't work for Google or Samsung, but i am typing this review on my new Chromebook).

4760,"This machine is great, provided you have realistic expectations for it.  The Samsung Chromebook is meant to be just a Chrome browser packed in a quiet, lightweight machine.  If you want to install Windows, Microsoft Office or iTunes (or any program), this isn't the laptop for you.  I think it makes a great secondary computer.  I have an older 13"" Macbook that I use in clamshell mode with in external monitor as a desktop.  I have that for when I need to access websites that my Chromebook can't, like a school site the uses Silverlight.  For most of my web surfing and email, I prefer my Chromebook.  The keyboard is really good (a bit slicker than a Macbook, but still good) and the trackpad is responsive (not perfect, but good).  The battery lasts a long time, especially when the screen brightness is lower.  I can even use Remote Desktop to get back to my main computer if I need to do something I can't do on my Chromebook.  The Chromebook is ideal for times when you want to just grab a computer and browse because it starts up VERY quickly and has a good keyboard.  It is lightweight enough that taking it to school isn't a chore.  The computing speed is pretty good, there is no annoying fan or excessive heat to burn your legs.  If you don't like Google Docs or Chrome, don't get this machine.  Google Docs and the other Google Drive apps are the primary productivity apps and I have found them useful for my light word processing needs.  I feel that I am able to get a lot more work done on this than on a tablet with a keyboard.  I find connecting a Bluetooth keyboard to a tablet very frustrating because of the inevitable lag.  For the price and for fulfilling its intended purpose, I believe this computer is a great value and makes a great second computer!

4762,"My experience with the Samsung Chromebook has not been a happy one. The little computer seemed to have bugs from the first day I woke it up. Unpredictable crashes, strange periodic slow-downs, partially loaded web pages, stuttering videos, and a maddening ability to drop Wi-Fi connections just when they are needed most. That last flaw has gotten progressively worse to the point where the Cromebook is almost unusable.On the upside the Chromebook is light, simple, and portable.More than that I learned patience. I learned to look forward to the various error messages shot at me by the little...devil. Messages like ""unable to connect to internet"" ""Network signal out of range"" and ""Ah, Snap!"" have become so frequent that they seem like personal messages from old friends. One, in particular, I find especially heart warming is theinsufferably cute ""He's dead, Jim"" which flashes lovingly in my face when something inside my neurotic Chromebook crashes. Instead of losing patience with it, and throwing it against my brick fireplace, I've learned to take a deep breath,and reboot...and reboot...and reboot with the patience of a monk reciting long passages of some ancient religious incantation.Would I buy another Chromebook?Nope. I'm not that patient.Update; My Chromebook finally died. It simply stopped working. Another family member has an identical model, so out of curiosity I borrowed. it. Guess what?  That Chromebook has the very same problem as mine did before it died. I know it's not our WiFi router because we also have a new PC laptop and an older Amazon Fire which work great on WiFi. Also, when I took the Chromebook to another location and tried the WiFi (a large chain coffee shop) the same issues kept happening. Again, maybe my experience with the Chromebook is an isolated one; plenty of others have good experiences. But, that doesn't help me. Thus, I'm lowering my review from two, to one star.

4763,"UPDATED on April 4, 2013: Yippee! This device now streams Netflix!! (It didn't when I posted the original review.)--- Original review: ---Okay, I admit it: this could be a honeymoon phase. But I'm really enjoying this gadget. Of course, it's not a replacement for my ""real"" computers. But it's fabulous at the things I use a computer for about 90% of the time. I check emails and other online sites, and I write. Sometimes I watch movies. This sleek, light, and nimble device handles all those functions flawlessly. With a very comfortable, fully functional keyboard built in.I bought this the other day at Best Buy. I'd gone in to the store the day before just to look at one in person, thinking I'd order it here if I wanted one. But I decided to just get it the next day instead of waiting for even two day shipping.My main reason for buying the Chromebook was for going online and making notes when traveling. I don't need to do offline photo processing on it, but I want to either upload photos to my cloud storage, or copy photo files from my camera card to other media so I have at least one backup copy. I've had no problems using this Chromebook to copy and paste photo files from an SD card taken from my camera, to both a USB 3.0 flash drive, and a USB 3.0 external hard drive. I've also played MP4 video files from both USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 external drives, with no problems. Please note that despite an earlier review posted here, this machine DOES have USB ports: one USB 2.0 and one USB 3.0. It also has an HDMI port.I'm learning the touchpad, although I prefer using a mouse.And now that I have the Chromebook I use it at home all the time. My iMac is getting a rest. It's there for the computing tasks that the Chromebook can't do. Like tax returns, and photo editing. In the meantime I'm running around with the Chromebook most of the time.UPDATE on March 2, 2013: I still love this thing and use it constantly. If you have a Mac Bluetooth keyboard, put it next to the Chromebook keyboard, and notice how very similar they are. I've also purchased a Plugable USB 2.0 to 10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet LAN Wired Network Adapter (ASIX AX88178 Chipset) to get online with Chromebook via Ethernet if I'm somewhere that's the only internet option. (I could have bought a cheaper adapter, but I splurged.)ANOTHER UPDATE on March 4, 2013: Yesterday I bought a Logitech Wireless Anywhere Mouse MX at Costco. I've been using one of these for awhile on my desktop iMac, and like it so much I wanted one to use with (alternately) my laptop and my Chromebook. I'm happy to report that I plugged in the tiny USB receiver for the mouse, powered up the mouse, and the mouse instantly worked with my Chromebook. The side forward/back buttons work with the browser, and the scrolling is great. I'm getting used to the touchpad on the Chromebook but still prefer to use a mouse when possible. This one is good. (The model number on the Anywhere MX Mouse box that I bought, is 910-003194. I don't know the difference between that and the model numbers shown on the various versions of the mouse sold here. Just saying.)

4764,"Ok let's talk real, because reviews are for people that do not know anything about the product. Let's do ""pros and cons""Pros1. Cheap2. Works3. Has everything you need.4. Cheap (did I say that again, yes cheap.)Cons1.Needs internet to work, don't expect anything from it if there is no internet.2. It freezes a lot, a lot, a lot. So if you are going to watch movies or especially youtube it is not for you, you will be more frustrated after 2 days of using it than if you were using a Windows 98 (yes I am old)3. No printer you have to use the ""cloud printer"" meaning you need another computer to print what you want to print from this one so basically you might as well use the other computer.4. It has to stay open if you are using an external monitor. If you close the computer the monitor will go off.5. You cannot install anything to it so all those software you have collecting dust use them as FrisbeesBut now for the price it is ok. For kids it is perfect. For students it will work. For hardcore work DO NOT GET IT!!!!!So there it is, simple to the point

4765,"I received my Chromebook three days ago. For my uses it is absolutely perfect. I really love this thing so far.I basically have four main uses I bought this for.First, I wanted something that sits on the end table next to me that turns on instantly and I can pop up a browser to look up something I heard on the TV, or figure out a place to go eat, etc. The Chromebook hits that right on the mark. I have tried various android tablets, and iPad, and MAc / Windows laptops. The Macbook Air my wife had was the closest but still I prefer the Chromebook so far. The main reasons are the instant on and connected (no waiting for anything what so ever after opening the lid). In addition the the browsing using the trackpad is very much like the MacbookAir (responsive scrolling with two fingers). The browsing experience is flawless so far, and seems really fast.Second, I wanted something to watch Amazon Instant Videos on, and while I have only watched a couple of trailers so far everything has been great. The speakers are pretty bad, but I use headphones for that.Third, I wanted to have a laptop up with ESPN Gamecast on during football games (and I expect to do the same during NASCAR season). I like to keep an eye on the stats without waiting for the TV to fill me in. The built in base (because it has a keyboard) keeps the screen at a great angle to look over and see without having to go pick it up.Finally, I wanted something I can take on business trips to watch videos. I will update my review when I have actually done this but it looks plausible to download videos and watch them from an SD card.I have tried many iterations (and frankly I have purchased from BestBuy because I can return them more easily after trying them for a few weeks). I have tried the MacbookAir ($1100 was way too pricey to meet these needs, but equally effective as the Chromebook). Various android tablets (the Slider was almost there but touching the screen to scroll, small keyboard, and screen angle). The google nexus 7 (great for reading in bed but not sitting next to the couch).The things that you probably still need a laptop for are Office apps (rollapps openOffice beta looks promising though), anything you need to VPN into to get to your corporate apps, and any windows only apps that have to be installed. Also printing is special. You have to use Google cloud print, which means you either get a cloud print ready printer, or on a computer that does have the printer drivers installed open chrome and use that to print through.Overall I am extremely impressed and happy with this purchase. $250 and does most everything I need. I would think that if I had kids that needed a laptop this would be ideal as well. They do mostly web things (facebook, instagram, etc), but the Google Docs apps (spreadsheetthey can do all of their homework with that. Everything is saved to the cloud (Dropbox or google drive) their documents, so no losing data.

4766,"With my Dell Desktop (10 years old) and my Lenovo netbook (5 years old) both running on Windows XP, and Microsoft ending support of that OS, it came time to get a new computer.  The change was going to force me to learn to work with a new OS, so I decided to give Chrome a try.Detractors will say that this is not a computer or just a tablet with a keyboard, but I just want something that does what I need it to do, and not something that I think I might want to have.  I’ve had the Samsung Chromebook for nearly a month now, and it has proven to be fantastic.  It boots up in seconds and shoots from website to website with no delay.  As a bonus, there’s no need for antivirus programs so I was able to get rid of McAfee.  The battery holds a charge for around 7 hours.Negatives:Keyboard is not the best for typing long documents.The display isn’t the greatest, but not bad for a $250 computer.Critics complain about no “CAPS LOCK” key.  In “Settings” you can change the “Search” key to function as “CAPS LOCK”.There is no “Delete” key, but if you’re using an external keyboard the “Delete” key becomes functional.Biggest problem is not being able to print directly UNLESS you have a Cloud-ready printer.  I haven’t wanted to make that purchase yet, so am transferring stuff to the old Lenovo and printing on the old, existing, wired printer.  Down the road I’ll probably deal with that.Along with this purchase I got a USB hub so I could use my old keyboard and mouse.  Both work fine.  I also bought a USB to Ethernet connector since I was going to be at a place that had only a DSL modem and no WiFi.  I bought an additional charger and a soft zipper case to protect the computer when travelling.  I did buy an HDMI to VGA adapter with the idea of using the old monitor from the Dell.  The monitor didn’t like working with the Chromebook and I couldn’t get the resolution set just right, until the computer just locked up and I needed to resort to the reset button on the underside of the computer.  Maybe the monitor is just too old.  I’ll look into buying a newer, better monitor in the future.Overall, very pleased with the purchase.  Also pleased that I got one of the last of the old Samsung Chromebook models.  The newer model is now just out, and while it may perform better (I don’t know) I cannot imagine buying one in plastic that’s made to look like simulated leather (?) with fake stitching around the edges.  What were thay thinking?

4767,"My Chromebook (I'm typing this review on it now) is literally one of the nicest laptops I've had. I've owned many gaming laptops and other powerhouse notebooks that would blow this thing out of the water peformance-wise, but this Chromebook is sleek.I was using the original Motorola Xoom tablet for the longest time as my intermediate internet device (the one between my smart phone and desktop). I was always plagued with shoddy word processing and web functionality on there and I wanted something with a bit more focus on the browser.I didn't get this Chromebook to play games. I got it to be a bit more productive on the internet. Since Chrome is my current most favorite browser on any platform, I was immediately familiar with the OS. It has a dockbar where you can put your programs. Settings are managed through the browser. Offline apps are also used through the browser, but that's not a problem.The music playback is nice. The video playback is great. My only concern is that it won't play certain video files like AVI's and WMV's. MP4's work fine. MPEG's work fine. 3gp files from phones work fine. There are a myriad of other video types that work great too. I wish there were some other way of playing those, but that's my only gripe.Netflix, Youtube and other video sites work smoothly on HD video. Sometimes it hangs up a little but stepping down a size usually fixes it.Browsing files saved to the internal 16GB SSD is easy. Even the 100GB of free Google Drive space is helpful for storing files. The SD and USB ports are very functional and sleek. They give me extra options of storing my videos, music and more.Word Processing is done through web apps mostly. This is nice for having a cloud back-up of your stuff. If you're offline, using Google Docs is your best bet.It took a bit to get used to the functionality of the touchpad. Two finger touching to scroll or ""right click"" was a little offputting at first. But I'm used to it now.Screenshotting is easy. Ctrl+[  ]]] takes an immediate snapshot of what's on your screen.The gallery offers some simple photo editing that even as myself, being a professional photographer can find useful if I need to simply adjust brightness, contrast and cropping.The webcam, while not the best resolution or quality, does it's job fine. Google Hangouts is the only functioning webchat service I've found that works with the camera. Forget it if you have Skype. This won't work with it.Websites function correctly on this computer with the built-in flash player. HTML5 works fine as well. Any Windows Media plugins will not function. Ad Block Plus is available as a plugin for this laptop, eliminating annoying ads, popups and the likes.Great product for the price. Excellent for students and professionals alike.The battery life if you dim the screen will last for about 5 hours realistically. More like 3 hours if you have it full brightness. It is very thin and fits into a paper folder just fine. I slip it into a hidden pocket in my backpack and no one will know be the wiser.The charger comes with a sufficiently long cable. The converter brick isn't overly heavy or annoying. It even comes with it's own retention strap to keep the tangles away, freeing you of hassle and stress. This packs on airplanes great and isn't cumbersome to remove from under a seat.I give it a 5/5 and will likely be using this laptop for many years to come.

4768,"Right now I'm writing this review from the keyboard of my new Chromebook, and I couldn't be happier. While this machine is limited in some ways (no external applications) it is truly the best ""2nd device"" you could ask for. What I mean is that if you already have a home computer that can do everything, this is the perfect, inexpensive device that can do *almost* everything.The flash problems mentioned by others are valid, and I am hoping for a fix in the near future so that I can use several websites (Adobe Story, Netflix, and some flash games as well). This is the main reason why my review is only four stars instead of five. (EDIT: Netflix is now fixed, and Adobe Story is working much, much better.)With the Chrome extension ""Chrome Remote Desktop"" you can connect your Chromebook to a your home computer and actually run most, if not all of the websites and programs you'd need to remotely. I use my Chromebook to access games and programs that I cannot install directly on the Chromebook, and it's a great, useful workaround for those people who absolutely have to have a specific program or flash website available to them.The machine is snappy and quick, and the keyboard is one of the best you'll find on any laptop. The keys are spread decently far apart and have good travel and a satisfying, yet un-annoying 'click' every time they are pressed. The trackpad isn't 100% perfect, but it is close. Two-fingered scrolling works like a charm, but there are occasions when the cursor will move too fast or too slow, which is probably more of a computational power problem than it is an actual problem with the cursor.For a web-browsing, email sending, blog writing, document producing machine, the Chromebook blows all of the competition away. I know there are many who feel it should have a touch screen, and I'm sure future models of it will indeed feature that, but for right now I'd rather pay $250 for a device that just works and does the basics, than paying $400 for a similar device that I can put my fingers on.If you're a writer or just do a lot of writing you're not going to be happy using something like an iPad with a keyboard. Trust me on this, as I have tried. Stop debating and weighing the pros and cons and buy a Chromebook right now. This little device is perfect, the battery life is outstanding (it's rated at six and a half hours, but I average closer to seven and a half right now), and I use it as a cookbook (with Evernote), a word processor, a web browser, and a device that I can quickly send an email on, without being annoyed with a finnicky touch screen on my phone.One of the best features of this device that I haven't mentioned yet is the quick load and wake times. I close the device when I'm done, walk away, then when I want to use it again I flip the lid and it's just there, ready and waiting for me. I love having access to the search button at my fingertips, too, as the keyboard button makes asking Google questions so much easier.Finally, the extensions and applications in the Chrome Store really do make this device perfect. I have Evernote web clipper, Clearly, Google Mail Checker, Google Voice Extension, Google Calendar Extension and many, many more that just give me all the information and shortcuts I need, all on one screen. This really is an amazing device, and when set up correctly it can and will replace your home PC for 99% of your computing needs.Buy one now. Amazing.

4769,"I love this computer for its looks. It is sleek, the keyboard is perfect in my opinion. It's just comfortable to type on and I like how the keys feel. The only thing that I would complain about the keyboard is that there is no Caps Lock key.. Which can be kind of annoying.I almost gave it 4 stars because honestly, you pay for what you get. I knew when I bought this it wouldn't be the best. However, it has served me well. The things I had an issue with is the touch pad. It sticks a lot. Or sometimes it just doesn't read correctly. I edited pictures on here through pic monkey and I had to move to another computer. I think partly because of speed (pic monkey had ads running on the sides) and partly because it is just not an ideal touch pad for things like editing and I'm sure gaming as well.One other issue we have had is that the sound just stopped working. We tried doing everything they said to try but it still doesn't work, so we're sending it in for them to fix it. They had good customer service as far as that goes. They are sending us the box to mail it in and everything.Overall, I do really enjoy this computer because it is lightweight and aesthetically pleasing. (I'm all about the aesthetics) but once again, you get what you pay for. This would be good as an extra computer. Or one you could take places like school or traveling.

4770,"I am no longer a student, I am no longer a blogger, so I don't have much need of doing anything that requires a lot of computer memory. I don't need powerpoint or photoshop on a personal computer anymore. On my HP laptop, I can't think of the last time I used any program (other than the web or my windows media player), and I hate always clicking ""no"" for the almost-constant automatic updates for all sorts of things. I bought my HP laptop in my last year at college (three years ago now), and we all know that laptops aren't built to last a lifetime. The only thing I really love about it is Windows 7, and I refused to buy a Windows 8 laptop. With that being said, I've been in the market for a new laptop for the past few months. But like I said, I don't need much of anything on a laptop these days. I had thought about getting an Acer Aspire S3 after seeing it at an electronics store, but then it sold out, and the S5 and S7 were much more (expensive) than I needed.Then I heard (or stumbled upon an article that reminded me) of Chromebooks. And at $250, it sounded perfect for me.A little about me: I bought a 1st-gen Kindle Fire last spring, and I love that for reading and light web-browsing on the go. Then last summer I got a Samsung Galaxy S3, and that basically took over for my Kindle, except for being able to read books (I probably should have just gone with a cheaper kindle then...). But neither the Kindle Fire nor the S3 give me good web browsing abilities.So far, this Chromebook fits my needs very well. It's small, it's light, it has surprisingly nice speakers, and WOW, it's so QUIET!! I'm also surprised at how FAST it boots up. Even from being completely powered off. And how fast it shuts down! Really nice. No more waiting for programs to load in the background!!I've never used a Chiclet keyboard before, so this is my first time using one (and it's a little difficult. Most keyboards I use are more cramped than this. For example, I think the ""backspace"" key is kind of far away, so I keep hitting the equals sign accidentally). The trackpad could be better. I honestly like the one on my HP better than this. It's just taking a little more getting used to, I guess. I think the screen is pretty good. I don't have any bad thoughts about it just yet.I'll try to update this review in a few days, but so far, so good. I've only had it about two hours so far!EDIT: Second day: After listening to Pandora pretty loud for a little bit, I've noticed the speakers can be ""tinny,"" if you understand what I mean. It's only apparent if the volume is really loud, most likely little vibrations against the body of the computer. A little annoying, but not awful...

4771,"We had a dinosaur desktop, an unusable laptop that needed $300 in repair, a 1st gen iPad, and a pair of Samsung GS3s. We needed something else...in the evenings, my husband and I would both want to use the iPad. My husband suggested buying a chromebook...it would be cheaper than repairing the laptop or buying another iPad. I was hesitant because I didn't understand what it was. Long story short, the Chromebook is definitely our first choice electronic now! Basically I think the iPad is a $500 game/app player. For everything else, the Chromebook is better. It has a nice keyboard, plays videos that need Flash, loads full webpages instead of ""mobile"" versions, and it can print pretty easily....4 things I didn't love about the iPad. And, since our kids were always taking the iPad to play their games, now I can shop online, check facebook or email, read, or work (documents or spreadsheets on google drive) without having to fight them. Also, the Chromebook has USB ports and card readers. AND, the battery life is amazing. For the price, this is a great buy, if you fit the type of user that it caters to.

4772,"This is a great buy.  Among the things that are good about it there only a few things, that, with a little thinking you can get around.At $250, there isn't a laptop that matches up with this Chromebook, its fast on, fast on the internet, and a quick little thing.College students will love this product, I am a Junior in college, and I find that some other laptops are too big to just sit around and type on, and tablets, while I own one, are to harder to type papers on.  This Chromebook is a good mix of both, it gives you the keyboard that you need, and it gives you the ability to carry it around like a tablet would.  I am typing on it right now, and I have to say it is fast.  Now people will say yeah but it doesn't have windows or anything.  Well since the update that Google pushed out, giving the Chromebook the ability to control a windows device remotely I have to say that, that argument is no longer valid.  The application works great and gives me the ability to use my desktop as a way to use Office, I haven't had a problem with it.  Then there is the battery life, I plug it in at night and the next morning I throw it in my bag and go, by the time I get home, after a day full of classes, I still have enough power to do some web browsing, it can easily last a day, with moderate use.Now yeah there are a few problems with it, first the laptop itself isn't the most well built product, and the keyboard again isn't the best in the industry, and the OS itself has some issues.  But don't let those little things push you away from getting this laptop, I myself am excited to see what the future holds for Google's Chrome OS.  I highly recommend this product to college students and to the everyday internet user.  It is the best value for your $250 bucks.

4773,"When my old laptop conked off, I needed a laptop to use around the house. I also recently started commuting by train to work so wanted to buy a small, light laptop that I could take with me and check email or facebook or read the news, surf the web etc. on the train. I also wanted a real keyboard for the occasional work-related email, so the iPad was out. When this Chromebook got announced I was pretty excited since it really fit all my criteria - light, quick to boot and so on. I received it a couple of hours back and I have to admit its really nice.I went from box to being fully setup (including my bookmarks and extensions) within a few minutes. This Chromebooks also comes with a lots of apps pre-loaded and I also got an offer for 100GBs of storage on Google Drive. Gmail and YouTube are also installed on the desktop so the sites I use the most are right there. Overall this machine feels quite fast. The interface is also quite clean and pretty especially the background images that come with the device.I like how light the laptop feels and that it can easily fit into a small laptop bag that I take on my commute. I could potentially leave the power cord at home as well since it's supposed to last for several hours without needing a recharge - so even less stuff to carry. It's easy to take from room to room within the house as well. The other thing I noticed is how quiet this is - specially compared to my work desktop or my work laptop which I can hear from another room! This laptop feels very different from all the laptops I have used in the past - its almost like an iPad but with a keyboard so its more useful. I am amazed at the price - this feels a lot more expensive.Overall based on the last couple of hours of usage I am happy that I bought it. This is exactly what I wanted.

4774,"A Chromebook runs the Chrome web browser sitting on top of a Linux core.  If the bulk of your computing takes place in a web browser, you will find the Chromebooks meet your needs.  If you need to run specific Windows-based software, this is probably not the computer for you.That said, I find my Samsung runs Chrome fairly fast, about the same as a decent Window-based laptop with a fast Internet connection.  There are a growing number of ""offline apps"" now, so you can do many functions if no Internet is available:  word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, file operations including videos and music, e-books, e-mail editing, games, etc.I like the full-size keyboard and the track-pad.  The screen is 11 inches on the diagonal, and the speakers are loud (though a bit tinny).  The display is crisp and clear; the surface is a dull matte finish which I strongly prefer over the glossy, glaring surface that most screens seem to have these days.  Wireless connection was extremely simple to set up, and connection strength seems very good.  There are ports for an SD card, USB 2 and USB 3, and HDMI.The weight is only a little over 1 kilogram, and I find that the battery life is pretty decent - about 6 hours of web-browsing.  I read some comments from folks who say the shell is `creaky', but I find the construction and materials to be reasonably solid - about the same as any other sub-$500 laptop.I think it is the ideal device for someone who would be okay with a tablet, but wants a full-size real keyboard rather than touch screen.

4775,"Chromebook:  I needed a new laptop and couldn't spend $600 to $1000 for a new one.  I saw a bunch of skeptical video reviews that were not so great but on Amazon the people who had actually purchased it like myself loved it.  My last device was an Acer Netbook that I paid $299 for years ago.  I bought it on a whim when I was traveling to another country just for Skyping back home and the option of being able to store photo/video on the hard drive.  I didn't think it would turn out that I used that little Netbook for everything but now I that I was looking for a replacement and based on my experience working with just the Netbook I wondered if I could do without an OS in general.  I did some serious thinking about what I actually do with my laptop I took the dive away from a full OS!Part of my decision.  Windows in general.  It's a good OS and tries to be everything to everybody but when it comes to my laptop it is too sluggish.  It's not their fault.  But, I didn't like being forced to Windows 8 metro desktop.  I can quickly learn it...but...nah.Also I was tired of antivirus, installing programs, spyware and having toolbars forced onto me that I have to uninstall.  You ever install something and then another program comes up and tells you it's scanning your registry and cleaning files?  Hate that.Another decision to give up full OS at least on my laptop:  My old Netbook is 5 times slower than when I bought it, not because I put anything new on it but because of hundreds Microsoft security patches and updates.  You ever have someone waiting on you? ""hold on I'm booting"".  ""Oh wait, updates"".  We're all used to it but it doesn't have to be this way.Earlier this year I defected from IE to Chrome as well.  A year ago if Chrome ""magically"" installed on my PC I'd immediately uninstall it and send a nasty message to Google telling them to f*** off.  But Microsoft stupidly put this banner on IE to try Bing vs Google as a challenge.  The searching was the same but the services were better Google.  And if you run those services on Chrome they are more tied in like auto-translation for languages and voice activated searching.Cloud computing / Internet privacy:Ironically I am not a fan of cloud computing for one reason only.  The NSA has forced all major companies to comply with the government's monitoring our data.  Do I have anything to hide?  Yes, my privacy.  When I use cloud services I save everything locally.  Docs, personal videos/music are on my USB hard-drive or SD card.  Yeah I know I'm working with files on the internet but I do what I can to minimize my exposure.VPN for work.  Yes you can.  I saw a bunch of post with people saying they can't use VPN.  But once connected it's all web based.  Chromebook supports L2TP and OpenVPN.  There is no support for SSL though.VPN for bittorrent.  I'm not sure but most those guys use PPTP right?  Even if you got your VPN working and bittorrent over web I would not suggest bittorrenting on Chromebook.  On a Chromebook you're always logged in and Google follows you around like herpes so no sense in a secure VPN connection if they can tell who you are.Blah blah blah...What about the Chromebook...It's about the size of a Macbook Air and weighs 3 lbs.  You can go look at it at Best Buy and compared the 2 models.  Yes I know it's no comparison; just for weight and size.  Man the price-tag was too much to resist for a useful device of this size.  I ordered the 3G model for $268 + free shipping.This Chromebook boots up in 8 seconds flat and goes from sleep mode in less than 1 second.  That means ready to use, not giving you a desktop and hard drive grinding for another 5 minutes.  You can't install anything on it so it won't slow down and I'm hoping it stays this way.You can install Ubuntu on Chromebook on top of the Chrome OS too if you really want an OS on there to run programs.  Basically Linux is running and you switch to it with a Ctrl-Alt combination.  Search Ubuntu and Chromebook on Youtube if interested.Ports:Headphone jack:  Not as loud as I like but sufficient. I'm sure I can work around this if I spend more than $10 on earbuds. hahaUSB 2.0 and USB 3.0!  I bought a Western Digital passport 1TB drive for $64 on Amazon which is USB 3.0.  Really fast.  Even the Chromebook Pixel does not have USB 3.0.  Go figure.  It of course has a SD slot for transferring photos/videos from your camera if needed.Ethernet:  No ethernet port but according to documentation you can buy a USB ethernet port.The ARM processor is nice as there is no fan sound, very little heat.  The harddrive is fast SSD memory so no harddrive sound.  I've watch 3 movies on it without battery running out.  The power cord is sufficiently long.The Chromebook is plastic and I understand it scratches easy so I bought a shell for it.  I bought the following hard shell and it fits perfectly, makes the Chromebook sturdier.$16 - iPearl mCover Hard Shell Case for 11.6"" Samsung ChromebookTouchpad:  The touchpad feels a little gritty but it works.  $268 remember.  I like the 2 finger scroll and 1 touch click.  I rarely click the touchpad except for the `right-click'.Keyboard:  This keyboard is ok.  It feels more like a PC keyboard than a laptop keyboard.  No function keys (F1-F12).  I've only missed my F2 key for when I am using Excel remote on my desktop.  NO DELETE KEY.  This is frustrating and almost a deal breaker but I'm dealing with it.Press CTRL-ALT-""/""  for keyboard shortcuts on the Chromebook.Speaking of Remote Desktop:I love the Remote Desktop.  I'm pretty sure it's the easiest I've setup and use.  This is just an App.  To use remote desktop to your PC make sure Chrome is installed and enable remote desktop.  If you want to allow others to connect you can also.  Once setup, you can sign onto your Google account from anywhere and remotely control your PC.  I pulled up Photoshop and Movie Maker and was able to use those programs just fine from my Chromebook remotely with little or no lag.I was initially planning on installing Ubuntu on my Chromebook but I can just remotely run any programs on my PC.  I supposed this would be a rare occasion and my PC is on all the time; Remote Desktop just wakes it up from sleep mode.  I could edit a photo save on my PC and send it to myself but most likely I'll be using Photoshop Express which is free online.  I didn't even know about all these services until I was forced to look.Printing:There is Google Cloud print but honestly I'll just do like I always have with my Netbook and copy the file to a thumbdrive then print it on another computer.Offline:There are a lot of people who say they need to edit their documents offline but I guess I'm not one of those.  Even when my Netbook (full OS) was in my car offline it was worthless to me without internet.  There is an offline mode for Gmail where you can edit mail offline but I have not tested documents but that's not why I bought the Chromebook.  I'd use it for movies or music offline at the airport but I don't need to edit a document.  But if I did...3G!!!I paid extra for the 3G not because I plan to use it all the time but I have too often wanted internet in the middle of nowhere for an email I was expecting or maybe a map of where I was.  The 100mb per month free data is all I'd ever use.  At least I have the option even if I had to pay for it in an emergency.Google Docs:  You can save in Word, Excel and even PDF format.I like it just fine.  I thought I'd flip out with seeing the splash screen for Word but now that I'm using Google docs I find it faster to load and work.  I'm using both Office and Google docs online now.  I think I'll end up using just the online eventually just because I don't use all the advanced features of Word and Excel on my PC and I'm lost with the new features sometimes.  I can't decide whether I like Google's services for editing documents or Microsoft's webapps.[...]Also there is a good online editor named ZohoWhat I wish I had known is you can save documents as PDF.  I don't know how many times I searched for a PDF converter.  Google has it free online.  Open Word, save-as PDF.You can edit a document on your Chromebook and walk over to a PC and type where you left off.  You can even reboot your Chromebook and it will come right back to where you were....I just rebooted and it automatically came back to this point in this document I'm typing.  Yes I'm typing this review in Google Docs and going to paste to Amazon.  Total reboot and back to editing was 22 seconds.  If I had rebooted on PC I could have taken a break.  I'm not dogging PC.  I'm just trying to let you know why I like the speed of not having a full blown OS.Netflix:Netflix works in full 1080p thru HDMI or 1366x768 locally.  No setup, just click the Netflix icon, login once and select your movie.  No having to mess with Silverlight or whatever is required on PC.Skype/Facebook video:Nope!  This is a negative.  Not that Microsoft can't make Skype online with html-5.  They just haven't done it.  I don't know what's going on with Facebook video chat either.  Chromebook is new so I hope they update this.  Just a couple months ago you couldn't use Netflix either but it's working now.  I could see this as being a deal breaker for some who use Skype all the time.  Me?  I'm sure I'll need it eventually and either they'll fix Skype or I'll have to beg someone to add Google Hangout to their Google profile.Facebook IM works ok.Also:AIM (AOL Instant Messenger) AIM Express ([...])ICQ Web-ICQ ([...])Windows Live Messenger Windows Live Messenger for the WebYahoo! Messenger Yahoo! Messenger for the Web (webmessenger.yahoo.com)Life without programs:Sure enough within 1 day of getting my Chromebook I needed to installed a program that I would have preferred to installed on my laptop; some test software for studying for a CLEP exam.  I put it on my PC but it would be nice to use it on my laptop.  I'm so lazy I remote controlled my PC to use the program even in my own house instead of walking to that room anyway.  But yes I decided to give up the OS on my laptop for the speed and ease.Apps:I looked through the App store.  Not much for apps yet that I cared about and there are hundreds.  There are a few photo editing programs but I'll edit on my desktop.  The only one I used was the Kindle App to read Amazon books.  One click and was reading my books.  Kindle books to read offline!No JAVA:I'm not an expert in java but I'd seen headlines of security holes in Java and Chrome does not support it.  I guess if you're considering buying a Chromebook install Chrome browser on your PC and make sure you can connect to all your sites that you normally go to first.  Like work, school, banks, etc..Video/Audio formats:I was lucky.  My whole video library is either MP4 or MKV.  You will not be able to read WMV without converting them.  If you use iTunes your whole media library would have to be uploaded to Google drive. For MKV video, I have not been able to use subtitles on video however but I have not looked too closely.Ok...this started as a review but ended up a novel.  I am just trying to be helpful and share my excitement about this new idea of having a bare bones computer.  I was looking for a small laptop with a keyboard, 3G, that played 1080p HDMI to TV, and could do some minor document editing that was fast.  I will always need a PC for home when I do video editing/games but this was a good replacement for my Netbook needs.I'm so sold on it I don't think I will ever carry a device with a full OS outside of the house ever again.  If you handed me a $1000 Windows laptop and said here surf the web with this I'd be like ""Naww..get that slow thing away from me.""  I don't have the patience.FYI - Chromebooks came out at $499 but are now sub $300.  The sales are 25% of all non tablet sales this year.---------------UpdateSpeaking of Photoshop.  This was the only thing I really cared about when thinking about buying Chromebook.  I'm starting to use Photoshop Express online.  It seems to have everything I would us for normal photo editing.  Also the battery time is quite nice.  So far so good.---------Update againAfter about 3 weeks with the device I returned it.  After my big excited review too.  The deal breaker?  Watching movies.  I watch movies 90% of the time on my laptops/ultrabooks when traveling and in bed.  The night time contrast on the screen I didn't like.  In the dark the white parts of the screen are ultra white and if you turn down the brightness you cannot see anything else meaning the darker areas are almost completely dark, no in between.  Sound.  Not on speakers but from the headphone jack.  I didn't know you could make cheap headphone jacks.  They sounded bad no matter what headphones I put in, no bass or treble and also the jack slipped out often. I had a feeling this would eventually break.  It was cheap so you know?  This was my own personal decision though.  I still rate it a 5 for what you pay and I miss the idea of not being stuck with an OS.  Unfortunately becuz I was so anal about this I paid double for a 11.6 Acer S7 1080p ultrabook.  Ouch..but it was my birthday.  If they had a better Chromebook I'd get one but they are either $250 or $1500.  No in between.  I miss the simplicity of chromebook though  I was forced to Windows 8.  I put classic shell on right away and changed all my file associations so I don't ever see the metro desktop.  bitter sweet man.  I was so happy with the chromebook otherwise.

4776,"Here's my personal opinion; I've owned my Chromebook since September and use it for school. Web surfing, accessing online courses and creating & sharing Google Docs.Pros:Chrome browser, Google platform work well with my preexisting Samsung Galaxy Note II. I've been an Android user since 2009.Keyboard is responsive and good quality keys.PriceWebcam - a nice feature for such an affordable device.Lightweight and compactCons:Speed. It lags quite a bit in download speed compared to my Galaxy and my Mac Mini.  This is annoying when I'm trying to get work done on the web, which is the whole point of this device.  It's not what I expected from Samsung. I'm wondering whether, like my phone, it would speed up if I installed an SD card.Display. It looks washed out to me- poor contrast and not crisp. For all I can tell, the only adjustment that can be made is in the Advanced Settings, under 'Accessibility' you can change it to contrast mode, which becomes a black background with light text.  I use this when I create documents because it's truly easier for me to see, but online it's a pain because photos look like negatives. I don't have any vision problems, it's just a cheap looking screen.Touchpad is awkward for me. The click function works with a very light touch, or a heavy push on the pad.  Many times I've clicked a link without intending to when I lift my hand to turn a page or something, then go back to the trackpad.  Perhaps I could adjust this, I haven't tried.Web browser is limited- I think due to lack of ability to install things like Java and Adobe Flash Player.  I notice it when I try to play certain videos online- it just doesn't work, tries to download them instead, but still won't open and play.This is just one person's opinion, but a warning that this device is pretty limited.  Great price, but I'm a little disappointed and find myself not using it as much as I thought.  Why would I, when my Galaxy Note II is so much faster and can do more? The only advantage this has for me is a keyboard, on which I can work much faster than a touch screen.Thanks for reading and good luck!

4777,"I bought this Chromebook for college. At first I did not like it because sometimes for some odd reason it turns off on me. I started using my macbook pro. If you are a student in college you get $100 off for buying a mac labtop. The mac is heavy so I do not like carrying it to school. I went back recently using my Chrome and honestly I said to myself why did I stop using this in the first place. It is so lightweight, it fits into my carry on purse. I love that there are already something like microsoft word on it so I can use it for school.Mostly all college students in my classes have a Mac but a few people never even seen this Chromebook and they even bought it because of me. They tested it out and they like that everything on this works perfectly. This is cheap and honestly way better than using a tablet.

4778,"I bought the Samsung Chromebook 3 at Best Buy... same price but local service and warranty. It works exactly as advertised. Remember, this is not a full blown laptop. It runs ChromeOS and whatever Google wants to add as an application. The main reason I got a Chromebook is for the trackpad and keyboard, as well as better access to web content. I can run Chrome (or Safari) on my iPad but I can't watch Flash content or navigate webpages in anyway like I do on my desktop or full laptop. The web just isn't built for touch interfaces yet. I also don't like having to run a websites dedicated app just to watch a quick video or interact with the content. I have a Zagg Bluetooth keyboard for my iPad but iOS's built-in spellcheck function doesn't work with off device keyboards, a bug Apple has yet to fix.As for benchmarks, the Chromebook doubles what the iPad 2 scores. It's twice as fast, supports Flash, better HTML5, and WebGL thanks to the Chrome browser. Google's sync feature works great too... boot the Chromebook for the first time, enter your email and password if you have an existing Chrome account, and all your bookmarks, apps, extensions, theme, and tab history are all right there. Chrome is also updated constantly and the apps in the Google Store can add a ton of extra functions. I use Office on my desktop and upload files to Skydrive (I prefer it to Google Docs) and Chrome works great. There are things Chrome won't do... Java, QuickTime, Skype, but I'd use my Macbook if I wanted to do those things anyway. This is just so I can browse the web, Facebook, Twitter, and read some email from the couch.Hardware wise, I'm a little anxious about the plastic build of the Chromebook. It's ALL plastic and feels a little flimsy. I tend to baby it, set it down gently, and take really good care of it. The keyboard and trackpad is top-notch and I'm writing this review on it. It has stereo speakers underneath and sounds better than iPad's built in mono speaker. The screen is bright and looks great streaming full screen HD video. A cold start boot takes about 8 seconds to the sign in, and sleep to wake is only 2-3 seconds. I'm getting over 5 hours on the battery with moderate use, just general browsing and video viewing like Youtube, CNN, and HBO Go. I don't have Netflix so I can't say how it does under a heavy load like that. The Chromebook is actually lighter than my iPad in it's Zagg folio, and more flexible too. The Zagg has a set screen angle but the Chromebook screen is movable like any other laptop.I recommend the Chromebook but you also must realize what you're getting... a $249 Google tablet with keyboard and trackpad. It won't necessarily do more than iPad but it does it in a more familiar and workable manner. Google is adding functionality to Chrome all the time so it will eventually catch up to iOS. There are even rumors of an eventual merge between ChromeOS and Android which would arguably surpass iOS in features and function.

4779,"I really really love my chromebook. It's a great size, very quiet, great keyboard, web pages load fast, I like the ""dullness"" of the screen that some others seem not to like - couldn't ask for more, and what a great price!Until -- a couple of days ago I was happily streaming video on Netflix, Hulu Plus and Amazon (I'm a prime member). Then, suddenly, in the middle of Downtown Abbey, I get a message that Shockwave Flash has crashed and I'm looking at the frowny puzzle piece. I check my plugins, restart, blah blah blah. All other sites are still streaming perfectly but not Amazon. So I call the Amazon helpline.Dude tells me my device - the Samsung Chromebook I bought on Amazon and bought a prime membership to watch stuff - is no longer supported by Amazon. I say I was watching streaming content until a couple of days ago. He says yeah now we only have Silverlight and your device is not supported, sorry.I can't believe that Amazon is going to sell thousands of Chromebooks and not try to take advantage of getting more profits from people looking to stream video. Can this be true? Somebody help!I have found a bunch of stuff online about flash players crashing in chrome but none of the tips have helped me. Could the Amazon help line dude have been right? Was my device kicked off from streaming mid-episode because it's suddenly not supported? This can't be right but that's what the Amazon employee told me. I'm hoping maybe someone replying to this can help, otherwise I'm canceling my prime membership right away. This is BS.

4780,"I started grad school last year and my HP pavillion I had during undergrad finally kicked the bucket. I needed a laptop that would last, at least until I graduated and found a job. My first thought was Macbook, but there's no way I could afford such a thing at the time. Then I heard about chromebooks and started researching them. What I found was an affordable laptop that should never slow down and offered a lot cloud storage (so I can access my work from any computer). The battery life on this laptop is amazing! I take night classes, so each one lasts at least 3 hours, doesn't even phase the chromebook, it could go all night. It's light as a feather, I highly recommend a case or sleeve to protect your investment.If you're a student, this is a great buy. You do get what you pay for because the screen isn't the highest resolution and it is small.Warning to the NOT tech savvy: This is not ideal for engineers, architects, or anyone wanting to run hard statistics and lofty programs. One of my classes required us to do statistics so I had to use a desktop in the library, but could save it in google drive. Cloud = internet, so if you're going somewhere without internet, download notes or documents so you may work on them offline.This product meets over 80% of laptop users' needs. It's very affordable. And it has plenty of cloud storage.

4781,"The Chromebook combined all the desired features of a laptop for travel. The battery life is a solid 6 hours and the size is perfect for an airline seat. Even more delightful is the Chrome OS. It boots up in seconds and connects you directly to your Google account in the Chrome Web Browser. Email is easy and documents come up for your work directly in the Web Browser. The screen is bright and the keyboard is superb, even for long typing sessions, far superior to any tablet or smart phone keyboard. At 2.4 lbs it is a delight to carry and tote. The Case Logic Netbook Sleeve is highly recommended as a well padded case. Otherwise, the Chromebook fits nicely in your average briefcase.  The technical details are even more impressive. The Exynos 5 system on a chip dual core ARM processor is low power and fast, 32 nm technology similar to a chip that would be used in a smart phone. This provides long battery life. The Chrome OS is easy to use, based on a Linux kernel, again similar to an Android Smart phone. So basically the Chromebook is a smart phone transformed into a laptop with a great screen and keyboard. The virtue of this is that the Chrome OS is constantly monitored for cyber attacks by Google and routinely updated when you log in, without requiring separate anti-virus software. It is such a relief to be free from Windows updates and free from the constant need to purchase and update anti-virus software.  The model I bought contains 3G mobile networking built in for $75 extra. This feature was well worth it and includes one year of data service at 100 mBytes/month with extra bandwidth available prepaid without contract through Verizon at $35 a month for 3.5 GBytes. This allows you to login and start working even if no WiFi is available.

4783,"I am a bit of a computer\gadget guy and have always been curious about the chromebooks.  The earlier versions seemed priced to high and they weren't available in Canada anyway.  I read the reviews when the new Samsung Chromebook was being released and was amazed by the price, battery life, weight and overall look.  When we were vacationing in the U.S. I picked up the Samsung and I am pleasantly surprised by what it offers.I really like both the device and the operating system.  This is clearly no frills computing that just works.  I love the simplicity and as a Google Apps for Business user really like the integration with all things Google.  While the chromebook is targeted at Google users it works just as well accessing Outlook.com and Skydrive.  Pretty much anything you can do on the web you can pretty much do on the chromebook with the exception of Netflix which will be available for this ARM based chromebook pretty soon.If I could change one thing I would upgrade the screen but I'm spoiled there as my primary PC is a MacBook Pro with retina display and my iPad also has a retina display.  In comparison to those higher resolution IPS displays the chromebook display is pretty plain.  A version with a better IPS screen for around $299 would be perfect.If you're not use to a retina display the display on the chromebook will not disappoint.  It is certainly adequate for the price and overall this is a great little machine.  I look forward to travelling with this computer because it is so light.

4785,"Google realized something most of us don't quite realize yet:  hardware is a commodity, and while it is still following Moore's Law with respect to overall horsepower/capability, for what most people do with their laptops/netbooks/tablets, they don't actually need a 1000-2000 laptop.I will add that in my personal computing wardrobe, I have a work issued Dell Latitude laptop, an iPhone 4S, a Dell Zino, an iPad 3, a Kindle Paperwhite and now a Chromebook.Here's the thing.  For work, I need a windows laptop for now for the reason most people do:  working with images, using Microsoft office, transferring and managing files, working on the VPN and collaborating with my customers and coworkers.But when my work laptop is off, there are basically 5 things I always do:  1) read books, 2) occasionally let the kids play games, 3) consume media, 4) surf the web and 5) email/communicate with others.Despite the assortment of devices I have, the ones I use the most are the Kindle and my iPhone.  The iPad is neat, but usually I find myself starting a task which is just easier with a keyboard.  It's become a toy for the kids and for my wife to use for Pinterest/Facebook.I really hated the idea of turning my work laptop back on at night, and I really felt like the iPad didn't enable me to do enough with it that I started looking at buying a second laptop.I couldn't find a laptop that was of decent quality, weighing less than 4 lbs with a SSD running an ARM CPU that offers at least 4 hours of battery life.  This meant either buying a very heavy and very cheap laptop which was prone to failure for $350-$450, or spending between $800-$1000 for a MBA or Windows 8 ultrabook.I took a gamble and purchased the Chromebook, and based on many of the mixed reviews, didn't know if I would be happy with the purchase or not.Let me get the negatives out of the way first, because there are a few:1.  As others have pointed, the body is not unibody aluminum.  It creaks and is plastic, so you'll get some moaning and groaning if you hold it a certain way, and it will probably have its paint peel over time.2.  The keyboard sounds like it needs to be oiled.  Never used a squeaky keyboard before, but whatever.3.  The ports are all in the back.  Can be annoying if you need to use them, especially USB.4.  If you are not looking at the display head on, it will wash out and be unviewable.  45 degrees or more from dead on center and good luck seeing what is on screen.5.  I would often zone out and forget I'm not using a laptop.  Since I don't use Google Docs, I would have to lug out my PC to edit a document.6.  This is minor, and may be user error as I learn to use the Chromebook, but since it doesn't run apps per-se, there aren't any alerts or notifications you can set up.  Example - on my work laptop I installed Google Talk, so I always get a pop-up notification in the system tray when new email arrives.  Not so on Chromebook.7.  The webcam is not good at all.If those are dealbreakers for you, you probably shouldn't be buying a Chromebook.Now for what it does well:1.  Price.  It's $249.  You get 2 years of 100 GB Google Drive storage, and 10 go-go in flight internet passes.  If you are someone like me who (up until now) pays Google for storage space (or someone else like Dropbox, box.net, etc), that's $120 you will save over 2 years versus getting a monthly plan.  The internet is also worth to me $10 a pass.  If you're a Google user and fly a decent amount, this is almost a no-cost purchase.2.  Even if you're not, I dare someone to find an ARM based netbook weighing less than 3 lbs that gets more than 5 hours of battery life with a great keyboard for less than $400.3.  Chrome runs fine for just about anything that is not CPU intensive, but again, if you need that level of horsepower, you either already have a Macbook Air/Pro or a heavy duty Wintel laptop.  For surfing the web, watching amazon prime, communicating with friends, viewing images, reading news and consuming information, writing your blog, streaming music, this is plenty sufficient.4.  The keyboard is phenomenal.  It does sound squeaky, but it's extremely comfortable to type on.5.  The trackpad (and maybe I have low expectations) works great as well.  No jumping around, getting lost on the screen, great responsiveness.  Beats anything I've used on windows laptops.6.  It's an attractive piece of hardware.  Derivative?  Yep.  But who cares.  It looks good.  People keep asking me what it is when I'm at Starbucks with it powered up.7.  It closes the gap for me between my smartphone and my work PC.  Would it be nice if it had a touchscreen and ran Android apps?  Sure.  But at $249, I can now justify buying the next Chromebook, as I assume at some point they will have touchscreens and run apps.  I usually have my phone nearby, so if I need to play games, run apps, or call someone I have it.8.  This is a negative of all tablets, but they're extremely difficult to use if they aren't sitting on your lap.  Reading books on a tablet is not fun right now, the tablet is too heavy.  The Chromebook is perfect for most environments - it rests on your lap or can sit on a table.Bottom line, this is a great device for what it is.  If you find yourself wishing your tablet had a keyboard, or if you find yourself using your tablet for nothing but games and email, then you probably will find this to be great.  If you worry about having access to Microsoft Office, or needing something which will let you print, or you find yourself often in places with no internet, you probably should consider other options.When I'm sitting around watching TV, or in a coffee establishment/restaurant, at the airport, or parked at work, I reach for my Chromebook most of the time.  If not, then I probably either need my work laptop or my phone.And since they're so cheap, I don't worry about buying the next one whenever it comes out.

4787,"I had, what the kids call, a first-world problem. I wanted a device I could surf the internet with while watching TV in the evenings. It needed to be something small (but not too small) and light that I could quickly grab without a big production of power adapters and laptop trays. My Samsung Galaxy Note 3 smartphone is too small to comfortably surf with for more than a few minutes. My Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2012 tablet has a terrible screen, and the on-screen keyboard is an exercise in masochism (I considered upgrading to a new 2014 model with the better screen, but I would still have the keyboard problem). My MSi GT70 laptop is too big and only lasts for about an hour without being plugged in because it's technically a gaming laptop. What's a spoiled American with a disposable income and no kids to do? I tried a Chromebook.POSITIVES+ KEYBOARD!!! No more uncomfortable, imprecise touch-screen keyboards like on my tablet. This Chromebook's keyboard is comfortable. I also love the direct, hard shortcut keys for screen brightness, volume, etc. without having to shift with a Fn or Ctrl key.+ The mouse pad works very well, and the Chrome OS has an awesome function where a single tap with one finger is a left-click, and a single tap with two fingers is a right-click. GENIUS! Why has no one else thought of this before?!+ Great battery life, so far, and the system recharges very quickly.+ The system, itself, is very small and very thin, and perfect for quickly picking up on the go or storing in a nook.+ The OS and interface are very straightforward and easy to use, and the two most important applications (Chrome and Gmail) are pre-installed. Just log in with your Gmail account and your email and all of your bookmarks appear magically (well, not technically magic, but something similar). Even though this is not a Windows OS, many of the shortcuts still exist (i.e., Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, etc.).+ Far less expensive than a tablet, and will provide much of the same benefits, plus a real keyboard.NEGATIVES- Screen resolution could be a bit better (1366x768). It's a little tough to go from 1920x1080 all day on my PCs, and then look at the downgraded res on the Chromebook. This is a big benefit of choosing the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 (2560x1600), however the Note 10.1 2014 is also $300+ more expensive.- Screen contrast isn't great. Adjusting the screen brightness helps a little, but it still has gray-ish black levels.

I had a huge Windows laptop that was so powerful l could have landed the space shuttle with the damn thing...but 4 months into owning it the hard drive crashed and I had to return in...thanks Bill Gates...maybe less Philanthropy and a little more of that old whip cracking around the Redmond campusThis chromebook is fast, intuitive, silent and just a joy to use. Don't think you can do anything other than internet web based programs because it doesn't work like that...everything happens within the browser (although Google Docs are amazing) Chrome store has the usual suspects of Facebook, Twitter, Netflix etc...but it's not like what you have in the Google Play store.Look, if you're like me and don't speak Linux or whatever it's called you are going to love this thing...if you're concerned with super specs, Linux Kernals and and any of that other computer lingo that would put a dead horse to sleep, then look elsewhere. If you want a fast, reliable super easy to use and type on computer for home or school, then you have found it. Oh, also, it's really really lite.

4792,"I'm on week one with my new Chromebook, which I actually bought from Best Buy. I would have bought it on Amazon but they were out, and I needed something as soon as possible. I had done quite a bit of research on this laptop, debating between getting this and the Chromebox, but eventually decided on this because it was cheaper and more portable. Anyhow, I will update this review as time goes on, but I wanted to post my initial impressions for anyone who is on the fence about purchasing this item over a similar low-end E-machines or Acer laptop.First impressions: It's smaller than I thought it would be, but I'm okay with it. It's still bigger than the tablet I have, which measures in at 10.1 inches. If you have bad eyes or like a bigger screen on your laptop, this probably isn't for you, unless you're planning on hooking up the HDMI out to an external monitor. The desktop environment looks remarkably similar to a Windows PC. The icons you will use most are in the lower left hand corner, where you would normally find the start bar. This laptop is fast and responsive. I generally keep up about 8-10 tabs on my browser, and this thing has no problem handling that. It really does boot up in 10 seconds (and in my experience, less than that). No waiting through windows boot screens, no antivirus updates to manage.I love the keyboard. It's a chiclet style keyboard, similar to what you'd see on a Mac air, but it is very fun to type on. The touchpad is pretty big, which is good, and you can either tap or click to select things. I'm not super impressed with the responsiveness of the trackpad, but I'll reserve judgement until I've messed around with the sensitivity settings a little.The lower right hand has the date and time, as well as a battery meter. Clicking on it gets you to the settings and allows you to see how much time the laptop thinks you'll get out of the battery. Fun fact: when you plug the laptop in, that timer changes to show you how much longer it will take before it's charged. While we're on the topic of battery life, I haven't really gotten a chance to put the computer through it's paces, but I have been taking it to class with me on Thursdays, where I'm in class from 11:30am-10pm, and I use it for a couple hours at a time, several times throughout the day. I left it sitting, off, in my backpack until Friday night when I got home from work (about 9pm) and just for funsies I flipped it on to see how dead the battery was, and to my surprise, there was still juice in it. I was pretty impressed, especially because some of the other laptops I've bought in the past really suck down the battery, even while on standy. I'll post more as I get more time in with it.I'm pretty deeply entrenched in the Google ecosystem, so I was already familiar with alot of the products; Docs, Spreadsheets, Music, Chrome, etc. I love all of them. They run great, and I can still take notes in class in offline mode if there isn't wifi available (which is almost never). Google Docs is just as good as Microsoft word, and lets you do cloud printing. What's not to love?Overall: I love it. The screen looks better than I expected (especially from a $250 laptop) and the boot time is a thing of beauty. I would definitely recommend this to anyone thinking about getting a cheap computer. This is the perfect laptop for someone who really only does browser-based computing. If you're not sure if that's you, think about what you actually do on the computer. How often do you run a CD with software on it? Are there any specific programs you need to be able to run (like Photoshop or music editing software)? If not, and you're like me, then all you probably do is email, Facebook, Google searches, stream music, and do some word processing, all of which you can do on this laptop.Update 5/31/13: I've now had my Chromebook for about 5 months now. I'm still very happy with my purchase. I've been able to use it quite a bit, and up until recently, I've used it as my main computer at home. Overall, I would still say this laptop is worth the money and I would definitely recommend it to others. The battery on this laptop is pretty good for casual use, but if you're a power user, i.e., you do some marathon computing sessions where you're using it for a 4-5 hours solid, you'll want to keep it plugged in. During the school year, I had about a four hour break between classes where I'd usually have to write papers. 9/10 times it would last the entire duration, and this was after being up for about 4-5 hours previously. A weird thing I discovered with the headphone port; I plugged in some speakers at home that I would leave in the computer all the time. However, sometimes when I woke the computer up and tried to play something that required sound, nothing would come out until I unplugged and replugged the speakers. This is a minor inconvenience for me, since normally I use the built in laptop speakers, but I thought it worth mentioning. Like I said before, overall, I love the computer. The more I use it, the more I like it. And it's still just as fast now as it was the day I bought it. I've tinkered around with the touchpad settings and it's better the more sensitive you set it. I've also set it on the beta channel, which means I get to try out new features of the Chromebook software before they hit the mainstream.

There is no viable word processor, you cannot have itunes and you CANNOT DOWNLOAD ANYTHING. It stops working constantly and then fixes itself later.

4794,"My 2007 MacBook Pro was having problems, and I didn't want to take the chance of being without the ability to get online and manage my business website. I went out to get a cheap PC, and ended up at first getting the Acer C7 Chromebook. After 2 weeks of trial, I couldn't stand it. I liked the Google system, but the screen was just awful. I went back to the same store to return it and get that cheap PC. I decided instead to try the Samsung Chromebook.It is well made, easy to navigate, the screen excellent, and I'm thoroughly enjoying learning how to use Google Docs, and all the amazingly simple yet wonderfully utilitarian apps that are provided free of charge. I've started using gmail and little by little am loving it over Apple Mail. The keyboard is very comfortable, and I feel as though I've found the business tool I've always wanted.I can program my WordPress business web page with ease.I'll probably write more once I've gotten more familiar with the tools and options, but suffice to say, after 2 days, I am duly impressed.

4795,"I received this as a present for my 16th birthday and while I am very happy I have a laptop, this one seems to have a lot of problems. For one, the video playback is awful. Being 16, I'm going to want to watch a lot of videos on YouTube, but because the Chromebook has a very hard time playing videos w/o buffering or freezing often, it makes it really hard to enjoy YouTube. Another reason I dislike the Chromebook is that everytime I update it, Shockwave Flash crashes and I have to Powerwash (delete all my data; basically making the computer like it is brand new) and that has happened twice in the last month. Considering I use Amazon Instant Video to watch TV shows and movies a lot, this is a big problem with me. I've also had a problem in the past with Pandora Internet Radio not working for a very long time. Not to mention you cannot download iTunes, or anything for that matter, because it only runs on a web browser. And (this has just started happening recently) it will completely shut down and restart at random. I haven't the slightest idea as to why it does this, but it does, which is quite frustrating. It also is completely useless when traveling unless you have WiFi. It is also kind-of hard to figure out where all of the settings and such are, but that's just me. Overall, I have had a lot of problems with this computer and it frustrates me quite a bit. So unless you don't watch alot of YouTube videos, you don't use Amazon Instant Video or Netflix, and you don't have any need to download anything at all, this is the netbook for you! Otherwise, I wouldn't purchase this laptop (unless you want to take your chances and see if any of these things won't happen to you). I am very disappointed in the Samsung Chromebook, and I only wish it would work properly.

4796,"I bought one of these roughly 6 months ago. Still have it, still works, still like it. Let's be real. You are getting this to surf the web, do your online shopping (hey, nobody makes viruses for these yet, right?! ... right?), eat your lunch on top of-- and it rocks at all of these things. I just bought my first, ""I need to run REAL programs"" work laptop-- while surfing Amazon from my Chromebook. I throw this thing in the kitchen to read recipes off of while I cook, and it blasts my Pandora at the same time. I don't sweat taking this to campus (I'm a Grad Student). If someone takes it-- well, I'm not out much money, and all my files are safely stowed away in this proverbial Cloud. Whatever that means, it works great.The only real limitations with it arise when you actually try to use it as a ""real"" computer. No, when your graduate advisor sends you comments on your manuscript, you probably can't read them. Because she likely made her comments in Word 2010, and for whatever reason, Editor's Notes don't show up in Google Docs. And if you try to do a presentation, borrow a laptop or buy an adapter, because this one probably doesn't plug into the projector. And of course, while doing ""Office-y"" things, you're going to be working under all the constraints of Google Drive/Docs/Spreadsheet/Presentation/etc. Which are all pleasantly functional apps, but they do have their limitations, and they DON'T work as well as you'd hope when you're sharing documents with people who are opening them in equivalent Office programs.As far as the trivial things that people care about in Web machines-- yeah, Google Chat is sort of not as cool as Skype. Or at least, the people who you have to CONVINCE to use Google Chat, because you can no longer Skype with them, will say so. (I like Google Chat, so whatever.) And the Webcam is pretty bare bones. Somewhere between ""Not bad, just looks like you smeared finger grease across the lens,"" and ""might have been captured with high-res potato."" Also, I found in Chat that I had to turn my own volume WAY down (so I could barely hear the person I was chatting with), or else they got really bad echoing on THEIR machine. Speakers too close to microphone, I guess?All in all, it's surprisingly clumsy-person-bulletproof, it does what you want it to do, it's less obnoxious (and probably more functional) than a comparatively-priced Tablet. No, it's not flawless-- but it's cheap enough it doesn't have to be.

4797,"Although I use computers a lot, my personal requirements are relatively light. Simple and easy is how I would describe the Chromebook. It took 5 minutes to setup after removing it from the packaging. It really couldn't be much easier. Recently bought a Mac Mini to use as an HTPC and central storage machine. The setup for that machine was simpler than some tablets and phones - and the Chromebook setup was just as polished.I mainly use it to access my Google account - music and documents - and surf the Internet. It's light, silent and very easy to use. The screen can washout if I don't get the right angle and the touchpad needs more gestures, specifically it needs the Apple style 2 finger back and forward swipe. That's about the only reason I didn't give a rating of 5 stars.If you're needs are similar, the Chromebook is an excellent value and one of the very few laptops available without a fan. Quite honestly Google needs to do a much better job of showing consumers how seamless an experience Google/Android can be. I mainly use Apple products but this Chromebook, the Nexus 7 and Nexus 4 have me seriously considering a change in the future - the experience is that seamless.As others have said, if you need a powerful computer for games, design, etc. a Chromebook is not a good choice. But, for standard, everyday tasks this is an excellent computer.

If you're on the fence about purchasing this chromebook, you probably already know that its entirely cloud based.  There are some offline features that you can use such as google document editing or video playback, but its main purpose is internet browsing.  For $249 (wifi version) this computer is a bargain as long as you don't expect an ultrabook.  Before purchasing this, I would suggest trying it out at a local retailer first to be sure you're okay with the Chrome OS and it being browser based.Pros:Quick to boot up.The mouse pad allows for multitouch for scrolling and right button mouse click.Very lightweight and compact.Descent build quality.  It resembles a cheaper MAC Book (Imagine that!).Display quality overall is pretty nice.100GB of Google Drive space for 2 years (this is a promotion).Fanless cooling.  It's 100% silent.Comfortable to type on.Cons:Battery life is short in my opinion.  I get about 3-4 hours of continuous use, I expected more.No illuminated keyboard (personal preference, but would've been nice).Video playback can be choppy at times.  This may be fixed with an update down the road.Overall I'd rate it 4.5 stars because of its shortcomings.  This product will not replace your desktop or even laptop, but if you are in the market for a netbook or want a tablet but you want a keyboard, I'd definitely look at getting this chromebook.

4802,"I really do like this computer, but of course it is not without its shortcomings. For starters, getting my hands on one of these proved to be pretty difficult. I didn't want to pay the inflated Amazon prices, so I had to scour every Bestbuy within the area until I hit one that had just gotten in a shipment (I actually ended up getting two).For the price, the Chromebook really is a pretty great machine. The battery life is wonderful, usually allowing around 6.5-7 hours of use. On this to note, however, the machine doesn't sleep in the same way that, say, a Macbook would. Closing the lid doesn't really do much in the way of saving power. If you are going to leave this thing unused over night, be sure to power it down, or you'll wake up to a dead battery.The keyboard really is great. The keys do tend to rattle a tad when typing, but hey, $250 bucks.The screen could be better, colors do seem a little washed out, but hey, $250 bucks.Really light, very portable. The main reason I purchased the Chromebook was for school, mostly for taking notes, and it does that really well. Easy to carry around campus, barely even notice that it's in my backpack.I had initially hoped that this machine would replace my old Macbook Pro, but realistically, after having used it for over a month, that seems unlikely.For one, Google Doc's is pretty inferior to a full fledged word processing program like Microsoft Word.Two, the Chrome OS seems a lot less stable than Windows or Mac OS. There have been a few times that notes/documents haven't saved, or saved twice and then both been deleted after trying to get rid of the duplicate copy. Apps will occasionally not open properly, sometimes the machine will start up and I'll find my settings to have been changed mysteriously, apps sometimes remove themselves from the launch bar. A bit frustrating, and one of the reason's that I haven't fully given up using my old Macbook Pro.Another troublesome issue that affected only one of the Chromebooks I purchased: after shutting the lid, the machine refused to wake from sleep mode. I looked up the issue and it seemed to be a fairly common problem among other users. Annoying, but fixable problem (switch the machine to run in developer [unstable] mode).Really is a great machine for the price. If you have a heavy computer that you don't want to lug around between work/school/library/etc., I would say grab this one instead.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE:3 months in, forced to lower rating. Notepad has on NUMEROUS occasions erased my entire catalog of entires. I had made sure to make them available both online AND synced to Google Docs. Were they in either of those places? No.Glitchy, unreliable, frequently fails to turn on, will occasionally shutdown for no apparent reason, or display a ""Woops! Something went wrong!"" message and then shut down.In hindsight I should have just bought another Mac, or, hey, even a PC. This machine really is limited by the fact that it does not have a hard drive. Keeping things organized is SUCH a pain. The interface is way too glitchy/unpolished to allow for an enjoyable experience. Really doesn't feel like a computer, more like a skittish tablet. Bottom line, if all you are going to use this for is browsing the web, go for it, but if you plan on actually getting work done, look elsewhere.

4803,"I bought one of these to use pretty much exclusively for writing. And though it is small and light and the keyboard is OK as chicklet keyboards go, I found it underwhelming.* Large documents load slowly.* It's laggy. I notice this especially when holding down the backspace key to delete some text. I always end up deleting twice as much as I meant to because it lags so far behind.* The spell checker tries to underline misspelled words, but often misses, underlining instead a different word some distance away from the actual misspelled word. This only happens on one of my documents, and I can't find other reports of this on line.* You can't have different spelling dictionaries for different documents.* Once you add a word to the spelling dictionary, you can't delete it. People have been asking Google for this for five years, and it isn't available yet. There are signs that it might be coming someday.So none of this is absolutely terrible, and more of it has to do with the Chrome software and Google Docs than the Samsung Chromebook itself, but you seem to be rather stuck with that software on this device, and it kind of adds up to a second-rate word processing environment that isn't really as polished as users of Word or Open Office or Libre Office are used to.I'd also be happier if the charger plug was a standard Mini-USB such as is used on so many other small portable devices these days, so I could charge it off the same chargers as my phones and Kindles.

4805,"I bought a pricier version of the Chromebook (Series 5 550) back in August 2012 after getting fed up with my Vaio laptop's slow boot speed and constant need to update software, both OS and AV related, all of which impeded my simple desire to be able to check email, browse a few websites for a couple minutes, and then log-off. The Chromebook satisfied all of my desires for a super-fast functional netbook so well that when my parents' desktop PC broke down, I knew precisely what to buy them for my father's 60th - this newer Chromebook.After setting it up for them - a doddle really, enter the password for your wireless connection and ensure you have a Google account and that's it - I showed them how easy it was to use. Simply open or close the Chromebook's lid to turn it on and off. Boot speed is literally seconds. Updates are necessary though these are few and far between and also take literally seconds to update. And browsing is completely straightforward - Chrome looks simpler as a browser than IE.Comparing my Chromebook and this newer Chromebook, there are some differences that are noticeable. On the newer model, the power cable plugs into the back, which is also where the USB slots are, while the 550 plugs onto the left hand side where the USB slots are also housed. Battery life on my 550 is a couple hours longer, the screen is larger, and it looks sleeker - the newer model folds up leaving a kind of line at the back making it look a bit clunky, design wise. Then again my 550 is also pricier (though with the cash-back offer Samsung ran when I bought it at PC World, the difference was only fifty pounds).But in terms of speed and browsing, there's no noticeable difference. My parents are delighted with the Chromebook and love the speed and ease with which they can go online, check email, and then turn it off all within a minute whereas their old desktop clunker took about 15 minutes to fully start up and, when it did, browsing the internet was a slow and joyless activity (my father's words).The speed of Chromebook's boot up time is because the OS is in the Cloud (internet storage) so without an internet connection, this device is more or less worthless - this is why I've kept my Vaio for Office, movies, and downloads. It also doesn't have a disc drive so you can't play DVDs or Blu-Rays on it, and you can't download on to it, so no iTunes, or anything that requires downloading - the plus side being you don't need anti-virus software as no viruses can download onto your machine.For those looking for an affordable and easy to use device but don't like tablets and prefer using a mouse and keyboard (a lot more people than you think) then Chromebook is for me, and now my parents, the only way to go.

4808,"I just finished a graduate program and have used this for over a year now, as a student, a job-seeker, an employee, and just for random daily tasks. I'll speak personally from how this has helped me in my specific situation, in case there is someone who may be in a similar situation.There are a few things about me that made me a great fit for this product:1) I own a desktop computerThere are some things I need a desktop for, and I have a desktop computer for those occasions. Interestingly, one of the things I learned is how little I really needed my desktop. I packed it away and didn't bother unpacking it for two months now. If anything it's probably a good thing that I can't play video games on this thing, so if you're a recovered game addict with relapsing tendencies (like yours truly), that's something to consider. But there are some things I'll definitely need the desktop for, such as photo editing, which I will eventually need to unpack the desktop to do.2) I use Google everything (gmail, drive, calendar, etc.)And so do a lot of my friends, making it very easy to work on Google and share my work with others. The suite of Google office products are pretty handy, and for most uses is more than sufficient. Because google docs do not count against your size limit on Google Drive, it feels like unlimited storage to me, and I've done just fine without any additional storage.3) I use Amazon Prime (mainly for movies, Kindle books)The vast majority of ""apps"" that you can add on the chromebook do little more than provide you a link, turning the bottom bar into a glorified ""favorites"" bar. The kindle is one exception, since you are able to download books for offline reading. Since I watch all my movies through Amazon Prime, it's not a big deal that there's no DVD player.4) I intend to carry this around all over the placeThis is ideal for carrying around because it's light and thin (I just leave it in my bag and I never think ""dang it, I shouldn't have brought my laptop today"") the battery life is great (I never really have to bring the charger unless I forgot to charge it the night before) and it's cheap (I've dropped it and I've dropped the bag it's in many times, but it hasn't broken yet, and I wouldn't be totally bummed as I would be if I dropped some other really expensive thin light laptop).5) The places I go have wifi anywayStarbuck's, McDonald's, school, library, etc. In my neighborhood there are a lot of places to go for free wifi.A few reasons why this product was not a good fit:1) Skydrive is not that good.This isn't Google's fault, but it does affect my review of whether or not you should buy this chromebook, because the chromebook is only as good as the apps that what it can run in the browser. The truth is that Skydrive is nowhere close to the much more robust Google Drive. It technically does a lot of the same things, and in some ways it is indeed better than Google drive at handling MS Office documents, but I've had too many instances where the website would fail and I would lose something I had been working on. No matter how many bells and whistles it has, the fact that it can't reliably work on things has made me lose hope on skydrive, so now if I really want to fine-tune a MS Office document, I have to find a PC.2) It's kind of weak sauce.It's okay with most things, and I can watch movies on it full-screen, but sometimes it's just slow, especially if you have a lot of tabs open. I've learned to be a lot more disciplined about tab-closing, and that's helped, but at some point the thing is just slow, and when I'm trying to work with two windows at the same time, scheduling things and responding to e-mails and such, there's a slight lag that will make things take longer than they would otherwise.CONCLUSION:If you're a no-frills kind of person and you're looking for something like this, then I recommend it, especially if you're broke like me. It doesn't have a lot of (or any, really) bells or whistles, but it can get quite a bit done. The times are a-changin', and as the cloud expands in the size and diversity of products they offer, this will become even more useful over time.

4809,"Chromebooks are a new concept in personal computers and it's important that you're aware this isn't a ""normal"" computer.  However, if what you need to do is limited to working in a web browser and you want a high-value computer (inexpensive), these are superb for a number of reasons:  - On a windows/mac laptop if you lose it you're almost certainly losing some data/customization.  With a chromebook you can buy a new one, login and you're back to normal.  You could easily mix up your and your kid's chromebook and not notice with the exception of stickers.  - You need not manage software.  I'm a software engineer and it drives me nuts having to apply updates and patches and troubleshoot why I can't delete files in windows, etc.  These problems are just not there on a chromebook.  - Guest computer.  Not something I thought I'd care about, but it's really nice to be able to hand this to someone visiting.  It's on your network and they can login with their own account or use the guest mode.  A friend of mine was really amazed when his various chrome plugins and bookmarks appeared.On the downside:  - Chromebooks are not extremely fast.  However, the battery life is excellent and it's quite inexpensive which make up for it.  Perhaps if they are popular enough faster versions will emerge.  I have no problem playing YouTube in full screen, but compared to my primary computer (a high eng macbook pro; over 10x the price) it feels somewhat sluggish.  - There are specific things you expect a computer to do which won't work, or which will need some special hardware or effort.  For example:  - Printing.  You _can_ print, but will need a ""cloud-ready"" printer which you probably don't have OR will need to print via another computer which has cloud-print software setup.  - Legacy software.  You can't use any software that you'd install from media.  Basically anything that this computer will do needs to be in the operating system (chromeos, which will improve over time), or software which is implemented as a web application.  The capabilities of this kind of software is improving as well but you're not going to be able to run things like quicken, word, photoshop, etc.  You can likely find web-variants of this kind of software but it will be different and likely more limited than what you're used to -- at least for awhile.I've also owned an earlier Chromebook, the cr-48 and while the ""matte black"" finish of that unit had it's charm, the Samsung is superior in every way that matters.In summary: If you understand the limitations and benefits of this model you'll be extremely pleased with ChromeOS and the Samsung chromebook.

4810,"Much has been said about this in other reviews, but I wanted to add 2 things.1. Got one of these for my daughter for Christmas (I already have had one for 6 months). Within 10 minutes she was editing a doc from her google docs account, was also looking at tumbler feeds and messaging back-and-forth with 2 different people through facebook, and was adding extensions and apps to the browser based system. And she never even cracked the plastic bag the ""start-up guide"" came in. She's 14 - enough said.2. Went camping with 2 chromebooks (I have one and my significant other has one too - she has also posted a favorable review of her's here) and they performed flawlessly in temps well below freezing. We were tent camping and it got down to around *20 and these things still picked up a park wifi signal and didn't turn into toasters or anything like that. I know this means something because her iPhone went into freakout mode from the cold at around *35. We have also dropped these a few times, had cats lay all over them, tossed them in backpacks that got bumped around, etc. While I wouldn't recommend ANY of this, I'm just pointing out that these little babies are pretty tough. There is no ""super-delicate"" glass screen that will crack if you breath on it funny, or very cheep keyboard that will spring apart the first time you hit one with any force.Update - This thing even got a few ounces of coffee spilled on it and stopped working for all of 15 minutes. A little time under the hair dryer to get things right, and it is back up and running. I'm thinking this thing is a plastic tank.Update 4/9/2014 - the Chromebook I got my daughter now never leaves her side. And the one we use at home sat in a puddle of water overnight thanks to active cats knocking a cup over. Let it dry out for 2 days and it fired right up with no problems (again, I would not recommend this activity). These things really are much tougher than you would think.

4811,"This is an internet machine. I've owned it now for close to two years. It has a very strong wifi signal and is fast. The keyboard and mousepad are simple to use. Printing is fine via the Cloud as long as you print pages directly from the web. I have had problems printing emails from Yahoo. Also, the printing function has gone offline once in a while, but was very easy to restore online with my Windows PC. I have also had problems viewing most of my Word documents on this machine. I know there are lots of workarounds, but some of them are very inefficient time wise and it is just simpler to use my Windows 7 machine with Microsoft Word to access my documents. Chromebook is OK for creating a new document. But this is not a machine to do work on. It is the equivalent of a great e machine at a dirt cheap price. I will always use a chromebook as my main vehicle for surfing the web. But I will stay away from it for business purposes.

4812,"Many reviews on the Chromebook have focused on what the Chromebook is incapable of doing and if you've done any research on Google's line of laptops, you're probably already familiar with most of the complaints: little storage space, very few apps that can be run offline, and so forth.  This is unfortunate as while Chrome OS certainly has several limitations compared to more traditional computing setups, what it is capable of doing, it does very well.I went with this Samsung rendition of the Chromebook over the competing (and cheaper) Acer edition primarily because of the 16 GB solid state drive that Samsung included.  The Acer machine might be more spacious but you'll find that you have little use for all of that space on a machine that is built entirely on accessing the Cloud (and, frankly, the numerous services that Google offers).  If ultra-fast boot times and complete silence from the machine are both things that you are looking for, then this little Samsung with its 16 GB SSD delivers.  I timed the initial boot at a brisk 28 seconds and the only hiccup from unpacking to browsing the internet came when I was accessing my Google credentials.  I've had problems with my Google password in the past so I use 2-step verification.  For those unfamiliar with Google's security services this involves Google sending a text message to my cell phone in order to authenticate my identity.  Once I had my code and was signed in, Google synced up all my data instantly.After a few minutes of clicking through a brief tutorial ""app"" that Google includes to help bring people up to speed with their new computer (and the different way that Chrome OS handles some things) I was happily browsing the internet.  My first stop on the Cloud? Amazon MP3 to pull up all my music and get some Journey playing while I checked out the rest of my new computer.  Most Chrome users are probably going to be interested in Google services like Google Music but I was very happy that a third party web ""app"" like Amazon MP3 worked without a hitch.  Like many people, I don't do everything through Google so it is good to know that Chrome OS is diverse.  Anything you can do in your traditional PC's Chrome browser, you'll find you should be able to do within Chrome OS (essentially a glorified version of Chrome).Build quality on the machine is pretty impressive for a laptop that costs less than $300.  Some reviews I've seen have complained about the poor quality of the plastic and while it won't win any awards, especially if you set it next to a Macbook, it manages to look stylish and feels firm enough.  The entire machine only ways around two pounds and everything about it is sleek.  The keyboard is a particularly bright spot with spacious, spread out keys, that look more at home on an iProduct than a cheap, low-end computer.  In fact, I can guarantee that the excellent quality of the keyboard's build has led to this review being needlessly wordy.I threw several different websites at the computer including Amazon MP3, Youtube, NBC News, and a few hobby pages that I go to and Chrome was able to render them with a snap.  After spending close to a year on my smartphone and Nexus 7, I forgot what it was like to browse the web in its full glory and if website use is your primary goal, you'll be very happy with how snappy Chrome OS makes the internet run.  Even with seven tabs open, I'm till running smoothly.  I was also pleased to discover that the audio quality on the machine's internal speakers is fairly decent though I did pick up some background noise.The Chromebook obviously isn't for everyone: it needs the internet to function and if you live in a rural area with spotty internet connection and poor access to wi-fi networks, the Chromebook is sure to disappoint.  If you are seriously considering this machine (or any Chromebook for that matter) you need to ask yourself how much of what you do on a computer involves the internet.  For me, a computer is virtually worthless without a connection so the Chromebook was an obvious choice.  If worse comes to worse, I have 16 GB of space that I can store Google Docs and a few choice albums on.  For everything else? I have the Cloud and the Chromebook interfaces with it magnificently.

4813,"This review is separated into the following sections, so if you are interested in only one feel free to jump ahead to that one:-Introduction-Google Drive, how I use it in an Office-based school-Computer Science-YouTube (different from entertainment)-Entertainment on the Chromebook-Screen-Battery life-SummaryI am a ninth grader. I looked for a laptop to use at school (we have a bring-your-own-device BYOD policy at my high school) and bring to the library and work on homework. I wanted something light and portable. I have a Windows 7 machine at home, and that's what I had used for school projects. I did not have Microsoft Office installed on that computer, instead I used Google Drive. I researched what a Chromebook is and I thought about how I would use it in school. Here is how I use it:Word / Research / Typing:Google Drive is more than sufficient. I am in AP Human Geography, and my daily homework consists of reading sections of the chapter and writing notes (summaries). My teacher posts the reading guides in a .docx format, and I have no problems with formatting. What I do is I download the Word file to the Chromebook's internal storage, then I upload it to Drive and select ""convert files to Google Docs format"". PowerPoints are a little trickier.PowerPoints:My Biology teacher posts several PowerPoints from which we take notes. Compatibility between Google Presentations and PowerPoint is not that great yet, so I just use the web-based version of Office at SkyDrive (now branded OneDrive). Other than that, I have no problems.Excel:I do not regularly use the more advanced features of Excel. For school we just use data tables and Vlook up functions, nothing too fancy.Computer Science:I am taking Computer Science at school, and unfortunately, we are taught the Visual Basic programming language, which is only Windows-based. This is only my generation's bad luck. Next year, the freshmen will learn C++I plan on taking AP Computer Science in a couple of years, though, and they use Java, so there will not be any problems with Chromebook compatibility.YouTube:I put this under a different section than entertainment because I am a YouTuber, so it is not just video-watching, but production and editing. If you plan on using a Chromebook for these purposes, this is not the computer for you. For video editing, I need to use my Windows machine or the Macs at my school.Entertainment:For games, the Chromebook is pretty limited; You will not be using this to play Minecraft or League of Legends or anything. You can use Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, and any other online video services. I purchased a cheap HDMI cable to connect to my family's TV, and we all watch shows together. Just keep the brightness down and this is great. Sort of like a make-shift Chromecast replacement. YouTube works great, I can watch 1080p video no problem.Screen:The screen on the Chromebook is a little dim, it is matte, so it will not be reflecting the light around you. I primarily use it indoors, so it is usually great. It will not blow you away, but for the price it is great.Battery life:Arguably the best feature on this computer. With 50% brightness, I can easily squeeze about 7 hours of battery life, as long as I am not multitasking, e.g. listening to music on the background. On full brightness, probably around 5 and a half hours.Summary:Does this replace your primary computer? Depends. Some things like printing are still not as clear and easy as they should be. For a student, this is great. It is incredibly fast, prevents me from getting distracted with all the bells and whistles from my primary Windows machine, and is super light and portable. I would definitely recommend this to any of you. Please make sure you do your research, if you have any questions leave them down below, I will answer them.

4814,"We went in for half the cost of one of these for our daughter about six months ago. She is in high school and was looking for the right combination of price, portability, long battery life, and utility. We can't say enough good things about the Chromebook. We were thrilled with the value and our daughter loves everything else about it. With thousands of other reviews, I'll keep this short. However:Pros:o  Priceo  Portability / weighto  Functionality (office tools, lightweight games, mathematics (in addition to some good graphing calculator apps, Wolfram Alpha is your friend)o  Long battery lifeCons:o  Higher resolution screen would be nice. Tablets are setting the standards here, and that isn't right.o  Occasionally (rarely) reboots on its own without warning. (updates? memory leak?)Recommendations:o  Definitely get the 3g version unless you KNOW you will have wi-fi all the time. You can do some things offline, but you'll miss the connectivity. Seriously, the approx. $100 prepaid for two years of lightweight 3g service is money well spent.o  The iPearl hardshell case is unobtrusive and adds some needed rigidity and protection.o  If you plan on taking this device anywhere I think a protection plan is a good idea. The world is out to destroy traveling electronic devices.

She had been using my Asus Transformer for a while now and loved it.  She didn't like the touch screen and liked a physical keyboard. So this came out.  Couldn't resist the price plus had been getting her used to Chrome for some time now.  Works fantastic for her.  I even find myself using it when I come visit. The only problem is that because it is very new it has issues but they are minor.  I found some issue using the Google Cloud Print but when my computer is on it works fine.  Great battery. Mic and Camera. Apps make it very easy to use. Great build quality and light weight.  Totally worth it.

4816,"With such a variety in computers these days it is difficult to decide on which product to go with.  I have the seen the likes of pcs and macs come and go, but Samsung is now featuring a new kind of device: the Samsung Chromebook.  The Chomebook is meant to make your average internet routines, such as sending emails and updating your facebook page, a mucheasier task.  So the Chromebook is a internet friendly device. The Chromebooks reminds of the WolVol PINK Mini Computer Laptop Notebook 7 inch PC WIFI internet Android 2.2 Built-in Camera 4gb HD 256mb Ram (INCLUDES: Velvet Pouch Case, Charger, Mini Optical Mouse) ,which is also very internet friendly. Much like the fortress, the Chromebook indeed has a quality of web browsing which is great when I want to dosomething simple on my computer. The difference between these devices, aside from price, is that the Chromebook has more features to it as it feels like you have your very state of the art computer(though that is not to say the Fortress is not handy tool). There is indeed room for this device to grow, but I do like what I have seen as the Chromebook is a handy tool for anything dealing with web browsing

4817,"Everything works on the Chromebook.  I have tested every site on the web that I use. They all work very well.  I thought that Dropbox might not work.  I was wrong.  Dropbox works perfectly. Email works perfectly. The Wall Street Journal Online and The Economist online both work perfectly. So far I have not encountered anything that does not work.  HBO GO also works.  Amazon Instant video and my Amazon Video library work. On Netflix you can only view and edit your list.  Netflix says you will soon be able to view movies on the Chromebook.I like the fact that I do not have to subscribe to an Antivirus service. I can buy things on the web and access financial accounts with much less concern about safety.Chromebook works faster than my other computers when I am on the web.  I purchased the 3G model. It also works on Wifi and I can switch to Verizon 3G at any time. Chromebook 3G comes with 2 years of 100MB per month of Verizon Mobile. After that you can purchase a plan or you can turn on 3G for one month at a time, or not at all.  Chromebook 3G works equally well on Wifi and on 3G.  It's very easy to switch from one to the other. On both the 3G and the WiFi model, the first time you board an airline flight that has Gogo inflight internet, you will have 12 free sessions.Google also includes 100 GB of space on your Google Drive for 2 years on both models of the Chromebook.If you use Chrome browser on more than one computer, once the Chrome versions are the same on each computer, you will see in ""Settings"" that you have ""105 GB.""  That includes the 5 GB from the Chrome browser and 100 GB for the Google promotion on the Chromebook.I store my files in the Google Drive.  I have been using Google Docs for a long time.  Uploading and storing Word and Excel files is easy and efficient.  You have a choice of how to store the documents and spreadsheets.  My longest Word document at present is about 200 pages.  My largest Excel spreadsheet has 11 worksheets.  I have not had any problems.  I can view and edit my files in the Google Drive. You can download your files to your computer at any time, and you have the option to download them in Word or Excel formats or in other formats including PDF.Cloud computing makes it possible to access your data from ANY computer.  You NEVER have to purchase a larger hard drive (or an extra one) for your computer.  How many times have you purchased a computer only to learn in a short time that it did not have enough hard drive space to store all your files?  The same holds true for RAM.  In cloud computing the programs are in the ""cloud"".  You use the program in the cloud and when you turn off your computer the program is still in the cloud. Computer viruses? They will become a thing of the past and hopefully so will antivirus programs that slow down your computer, interfere with proper functioning, and cost lots of money.Chromebook also works offline, if you wish.  You can do email and documents offline. Everything syncs when you go back online.Chromebook has one other very nice feature: the price.  You are getting lots of value for your money.  Chromebook is perfect for school, unless you want to spend a few thousand dollars on a notebook that some other person may wish to steal.Consider what might happen if you write an important paper, and when you are finished, your computer crashes?  What do you do?  Well, if you stored your work in the cloud, you can go to any other computer and get it back instantly.Chromebook is well made.  The screen is perfect.  Chromebook weighs less than 2½ pounds.  The keyboard is also perfect. Chromebook is beautiful.Chromebook updates automatically.  You never have to wait and restart.Computers are changing rapidly.I wrote this review in Google Docs in Google Drive.Cloud computing is here to stay.Chromebook will only get better.

4819,"I've had the Samsung Chromebook Series 3 WiFi for a couple of weeks now and am very pleased with it. As a writer, I was particularly impressed with the following:1) Excellent keyboard. Unlike many laptops, the keyboard works well with touch-typing. For my use, the keyboard is the most important part of the computer.2) Very nice matte non-glare screen. Nothing worse than trying to work on a screen which is full of reflections.3) Convenient size and weight. Very portable, but still just big enough to be fully functional.4) Marvelous battery life. I get over 7 hours. The fact that it can recharge in 2.5 hours is another plus.5) Nice ""sleep"" mode. Just close the cover and it goes to sleep. While sleeping battery use is very low. After sleeping it for 9 hours, I lost only 5% of the charge.6) Price. For $250, this is certainly a quality machine.As to working off the internet, it does just fine in documents and spreadsheets which I have stored on Google Drive. I can work on these documents with or without a WiFi connection. The Drive word processor is so similar to Word that I don't really notice the difference. There is something of a learning curve with the Google system and some of the keys are set up differently, but nothing overwhelming.For what I want to do (writing), this machine works quite well and I am pleased with it.

4821,"For my birthday, I got a Samsung Chromebook. I have been using it for a while now and thought I would share my thoughts on the computer and, more importantly, the Chrome OS. I'm a professor, so I will say a bit on the usefulness of the Chromebook in the academic setting.There are a variety of Chromebooks ranging from the $200 ""netbook"" models to the $1500 Pixel. I have the $249 Samsung Chromebook and consider it to be the optimal Chromebook at this time, in terms of price, weight and capabilities.In terms of the hardware, this Chromebook is quite adequate for the Chrome OS. It has 2 GB of RAM, 16 GB of eMMC storage, a 1.7 GHz Exynos 5000 Series processor,and  a screen resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels.  Subjectively, the screen is sharp and handles color well. The sound is what one would expect from such a device-less than awesome, but not awful. For those concerned about size and weight, it weighs 2.4 pounds and measures 10.4 X 8.09 X .69 (inches). For ports and slots, it has 1 USB 2.0 port, 1 USB 3.0 Port, an HDMI port, a headset port and a SD card slot. With the right HDMI to VGA adapter, it can output to a VGA monitor or projector-be sure the adapter works with the Chromebook before buying it, though. While the USB ports allow the user to plug in any USB device, the Chrome OS has extremely limited support for devices. As a general rule, if a device requires you to install a driver then it will not work with Chrome OS. Fortunately, USB storage devices work fine. This laptop also has wi-fi (which is essential) and Bluetooth. It has, of course, a webcam.My subjective assessment is that the hardware is reasonably matched to the price. The keyboard is not exceptional but is reasonably comfortable to use. I am not a big fan of trackpads and the trackpad on the laptop did nothing to change my mind.  Fortunately, many wireless Bluetooth mice work with it (but not all). I do like the laptops  size and weight-I can easily put it in my backpack and carry it around all day.What makes a Chromebook a Chromebook is, of course, the Chrome OS. Roughly put the Chrome OS is essentially a browser operating system: almost everything you do, you do in the Chrome browser. As such, if you want to get a very good idea what using a Chromebook is like, fire up Chrome and try to do what you want to do.There are some advantages to the Chrome OS. First, it is a lightweight OS and hence it boots fast. Second, it is a fairly simple OS and hence has somewhat fewer problems than more robust operating systems like Windows, Mac and full Linux systems.  You set up your Chromebook in seconds: turn it on, log in to your Google account and you are ready. This is in contrast with the time and effort it takes to get a Mac or Windows laptop up and running. Third, Google handles all the updates and as long as you connect to the internet you will have the latest version of the OS. There is, for the most part, no messing around with updating. Fourth, the Chrome OS is obviously integrated with Google's software. When I got my Chromebook, I also got two years of 100 GB of storage on GoogleDrive, which is supposed to be worth $120. If you use GoogleDrive, you can look at a Chromebook as a $130 laptop with the GoogleDrive subscription. Looked at that way, it is an excellent deal. Fifth, there are many good apps available for Chrome ranging from word processing apps to games.There are also some major disadvantages to the Chrome OS. First, being a minimalist and simple OS it provides little to no support for devices. As mentioned above, while it has USB ports, most devices will not have drivers and hence will not work. Storage devices are, however, the exception. Second, printing from Chrome OS requires either a printer that works with Cloud Print or having another computer set up to handle the printing connection. Third, with the exception of the offline apps available at the Chrome Store, the user cannot install software in Chrome. While the Chrome OS obviously cannot run Windows and Mac software, the limited number of truly useful or good offline apps makes being offline a problem. Fortunately, Google's core software (such as Google Docs) works offline so you can still edit and create documents. However, you will only have access to your local files when offline. One thing that obviously mitigates the offline issue is that cloud computing is almost now the rule rather than the exception. However, when considering a Chromebook you will want to consider your software needs. To see if Chrome OS will be adequate offline, fire up Chrome and disconnect your PC from the internet (be sure to set up your Google drive so you can work offline).While the Chrome OS has rather serious limitations, as long as they are taken into account a Chromebook can be very useful. In my case, I use my Chromebook in two main roles. The first is as my ""web"" laptop. Since Chrome OS is essentially a browser, I can do all my web activities, such as blogging and email  with the laptop. Since it boots almost instantly, has a great battery life and is light I find it ideal for when I need to do something online quickly or want to be away from my desktop (like outside in the sun).The second role  is as my academic laptop. While I do create most of my content in Word, PowerPoint, Respondus, Acrobat and Illustrator, most of my teaching involves Blackboard  and email. Blackboard works fine with the Chromebook, so I can edit/create exams, check on student grades, view assignments and so on. Obviously, web-based email also works fine on a Chromebook. I also use it at meetings-I can take notes using Google Docs or Evernote (or pretend to do so). Previously I used a first generation iPad for that, but rather prefer the Chromebook's keyboard. With the iPad I had to bring a Bluetooth keyboard and poke at the screen with my finger. The Chromebook weighs about the same as the iPad plus keyboard and word processing is much easier on the Chromebook-at least for me,  but I grew up using a typewriter rather than texting.I think students would find this Chromebook a good choice. First, while it is not as sexy-cool as an iPad, it costs half the price of the basic iPad and comes with a keyboard. Second, for students who do not need specialized software it has what they will need: the ability to write papers, do email and so on. Since many professors use Blackboard these days, the poor handling of printing will generally not be an issue.  Also, most campuses have wireless and hence being offline will not be an issue.  Third, it is light and small which makes it easy to carry about between classes. Fourth, its connection to Google Drive means that files will be generally safe from computer issues (or the laptop being stolen). On the downside, this could rob a student of many of the usual excuses involving computers and work that has not been done.Overall, I would recommend the Samsung Chromebook-but be sure to keep in mind its limitations. If you are looking for a low-cost ""web"" laptop, it is hard to beat. If you need a robust computer to run traditional programs, you'll need to go with a Mac, Linux or Windows laptop.

I use and abuse it daily and it has stood the test of time. It's so incredibly reliable. No freezes, no virus issues, no problems, ever. It's rare to find such a problem free product in electronics where most things are expected to be disposed of within 24 months. It's the perfect extra internet device for families where everyone wants to be online all the time. Don't buy your kids expensive macbooks they will probably break within a year.

For everyday, I use the Acer because of the keyboard.  For movies, webcam, videos, I use the Samsung.I only use my windows based laptop for printing, external harddrive, etc. since its my ""base"" and I don't move it around the house.  (Note Google has a cloud base print service for free.  I use that to print when I'm on my chromebooks.)I use the Chromebooks 99% of the time and am thinking of switching out my Windows laptop with the Acer due to the extra video port.  I wish the Samsung had a better keyboard layout else I would say only get the Samsung. If not having a home/end/delete/page up/down doesn' bother you, just get the Samsung.Note: The OS is Chrome, not Windows...and it plays everything Netflix, Hulu, etc.

4824,"Anybody who is really upset by their chromebook isn't being realistic. THIS PRODUCT IS FOR CLOUD USERS!! If you use google drive  and google docs then this is going to be a breeze for you. I am a college student and use evernote for everything school related and i can honestly say this is the smartest purchase i have made (except for evernote premium). The awesome battery life (6-8 hours) makes it a no brainer compared to the Acer version (3-3.5 hours) in my opinion. Everything i do is cloud based however and i feel like if you are not living in some sort of cloud ecosystem then this is NOT for you.An example of how to live in the cloud using a chromebook.Music- Google Music & PandoraDocuments - Google Docs, Evernote, and even Skydrive has a version of office 360.Storage- Google gives chromebook users 100gb of cloud storage to be used for whatever. But you can get an additional 25 from dropbox by doing some extra work.Remote PC- Using the chrome remote desktop.Video- Plex, Youtube, Vimeo, Netflix*****************This brings me to my only gripe about this chromebook, for some reason this specific version of the chromebook can not play netflix right now. Google says they are working quickly to get it resolved and as soon as they do resolve this i will be happy to rate this a full 5 stars.Chrome OS is not quite able to completely eliminate the need for having a PC, however if you have a full blown PC for a few specific things then this is an awesome companion for an awesome price. (I have a desktop for more power hungry things and this is my only laptop and everyday computer!)

4825,"This computer is very fast. Let me start off by making that clear, it loads quicker than I could have dreamed a computer could.But, we had to replace it with an HP. It's difficult to nagivate the ""apps"" for it and next to nothing is compatible with it. I can't even use my brand new printer with it. You can't hardly use it unless you are connected to the internet. It has google docs which is an online word program. Key there: Online. So if your working late on a research paper, don't count on being mobile unless you have a hot spot you could take along.The mouse is the worst problem for us. You have to use two fingers to do the ""Right click"" but that only works for me about 1 every 100 times and only if I'm very careful about it. The mouse has stuck from the very beginning whenever it gets clicked. It holds down. Scrolling is weird no matter what page I'm on.Over all we think this thing was a waste of time. We received it free from our school which we were excited about but ultimately were forced to buy a new PC. Maybe if your a gamer. Maybe. We couldn't get any of our games to install on it, so good luck.

4826,"My name is Chris and I am currently a freshman in college. As a college student, I find the Samsung Chromebook to be extremely convenient. At $250, this laptop is a steal.First off, let me say that this is not your normal laptop. You cannot get Microsoft Office on this device as well as you cannot download really any programs on it. The Chromebook operates on the Cloud and strictly on Google's programs; whether it be G-mail, Google Drive, Google Calendar, Google Keep, etc. So if you are not already a ""Google-ite"", once you purchase this laptop you will become one.The Chromebook laptop has very minimal internal storage space. So your files and pictures and such do not get stored physically on the computer. Your files and pictures and whatever else you might be saving get put on the Cloud on Google Drive. Upon the purchase of your Chromebook, you receive a free 100 GB of Google Drive storage for 2 years. So you don't really need to worry about running out of room in the cloud. This laptop operates solely on Wi-Fi connection. Everything that you do on this laptop is in a sense, on the Google Chrome browser. So you will need internet for almost all functions on this laptop. However, there is an offline mode if you do not have Wi-Fi connection where you can still type up documents and such.If you're trying to decide what computer to get for college and you're going through a rough time deciding if you want a desktop with a laptop, if you want only a laptop, or if you want to go the tablet route, I was in the exact same boat when I was deciding what I wanted. After having been in college now for 2 and a half months now, I am very happy with my decision with the Chromebook. I myself have an iMac desktop computer in my dorm room as my main computer and I take my Chromebook to class. I use it every day and it is works perfectly for in class usage. I will go to class or go to the library and type up whatever I need to on Google Docs or Google Sheets, and if I need to print it out or if I want to edit the format of the document a little bit more, I will download the Google Drive document onto my desktop and then edit them in Microsoft Office. (Sort of a system that I have developed)The one thing about this computer that I have to point out is the battery life. I have found that the standby battery life on the Chromebook is not as good as you think it would be.If you are in search of a portable computer for college, I would definitely recommend this computer to you. It is very convenient, extremely light, and a cute and small size. However, personally I would NOT get this Chromebook if you plan on making this your main computer. The Chromebook is a cheap alternative to a laptop that is best for carrying around in your backpack as an addition to your main computer. I personally find myself using my Chromebook more than I do my desktop computer.However making this laptop your main computer IS doable, it is not IDEAL but it can be done. Really, in this day in age, Microsoft Office is not entirely necessary. Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides are pretty good alternatives to Microsoft Office. BUT, the Google word processors do not have nearly as many functions as Microsoft Office has, so be forewarned. The Google applications have all of the basic functions... nothing more.IN MY OPINION:I have looked at other people who use tablets as their in-class computers and I have talked with them to see how they like their decision to go with the tablet route, and most of them say that they regret the decision to go tablet instead of laptop. They claim that it is difficult to keep up with the professor trying to continually type on the touchscreen. (Although there are now keyboards for your tablets). So, as a current college student, I recommend weigh your options before going the tablet route for your in class computer. And I would DEFINITELY consider the Samsung Chromebook.

4827,"I bought the Samsung Chromebook becasue I wanted a laptop, the price was right and it looked nice.  I then got it, and sadly there was no mention that there was no disc drive, nor could you play games, or even use itunes.  This was just wrong.  I immediately packed it back up and sent it back.  Something like this should be told.

4828,"Just a little bit of background about myself, I am a bit of a tech gadget junkie.  In our house we have an Ipad 2nd Gen, a Kindle Fire, A nexus 7, android smartphones , and I have a fairly powerful i7 2nd gen laptop which I regrettably installed Windows 8.1 on.Out of all the gadgets I own, this Samsung Chromebook is my go to gadget that I use probably 95% of the time when I am home.The reason why I choose the Chromebook is because like a tablet it turns on very fast, almost instantly. It's light like a tablet and it's easy to use if you are laying on the bed, sitting on the couch, or sitting at a table. You get a full web browser experience as apposed to a mobile web version, and the battery life is pretty good.How I use the Chromebook:I have no business need for a computer at home, I generally just surf the internet use email and I maintain a simple spreadsheet for my personal budget, I sometimes watch videos on Netflix with headphones when my wife is sleeping and I don't want the TV on in bed. I have also used it to upload camera pictures and videos to my google drive or to youtube.I have read plenty of reviews about Chromebooks and the people that are anti-Chromebook argue that you can buy a full blown laptop for at or near the same price that can run a chrome browser that can do everything plus more than a Chromebook. At one time I agreed with that sentiment but after using a Chromebook I changed my mind. Yes you can buy a cheap windows laptop that can do more but it will be a junky, slow machine that won't boot up as fast. Even my fast i7 laptop annoys me that even when it's in sleep mode it still takes more than a minute to sign in and begin using it, and because I don't use it so often it often has several updates that tend to bog down the machine and I don't want to even begin a rant about how I hate the windows 8 experience on a non touch screen laptop.Cons:The display isn't fantastic on the Samsung Chromebook and the build quality isn't premium but it is on par with the price.The touchpad isn't so easy to use like if you want to cut and paste text.When the chromebook is closed part of the keys touch the sceen and it leaves a dirt line on my screen.11 in. screen can sometimes be a bit too small.I still need to use my Windows laptop if I want to burn CD's or if I need to upgrade my GPS firmware or load songs on an Ipod.My Recommendation:I highly recommend purchasing a Chromebook as a secondary device if you can afford the luxury, I call it secondary even though its really my primary, but I still can't do without a PC.I would recommend getting a newer model such as the HP Chromebook 14 -- The one with the intel Haswell processor and 14"" screen and 4gb ram (at the time of this writing it's not available on Amazon, only a 2gb version), or the Acer C720. I personally will opt for the larger screen when it is time for me to upgrade.

4829,"So disappointed in this purchase. I've given it enough time and this things just sucks. Very limited functionality and forget customer service and troubleshooting. Buy the chromebook if you want to be lonely and marginalized because you won't be able to do anything with it.

4830,"I bought the Samsung Chromebook with the idea in mind that it was even smaller than my laptop and would work great to read books on the go without having to drag along my kindle as well as my phone as well as...blah blah blah. Sometimes I honestly feel like all of my various devices turn me into a walking satellite receiver. The first thing I took note of when using the chromebook for the first time was how easy it was to set it up and make it personal. There is a handy one screen guide to walk you through the process. It is all pretty straight forward and if you are a user of google chrome, you pretty much have it in the bag already.I set up the chromebook and downloaded the apps I would need to use offline and found the process simple and satisfying. Typing on the chromebook is pretty much the same as on any other keyboard with the noted exception that the keys have somewhat large spaces between them which can cause my typing to be a little awkward since I am used to my laptop where the keys are all close together.The screen has beautiful even illumination and the apps download very quickly. It was a bit of a change to go from windows to the google operating system and took me a few days to organize things to where I could easily access them and remember where I put them.As for battery life, this thing rocks! I have used this thing for seven hours before and still had it estimate that I had over an hour left. Mostly I use the chromebook for business applications and perusing the web for my job so I have not had to much experience playing movies on it or listening to music. I don't do much with multimedia.So far it was a great purchase and I have been thrilled with it after a month of use. If you are looking for a lightweight, portable device to fill your basic needs, this is an excellent choice.

4831,"The Samsung Chromebook was very attractive to me for many reasons: 1) I'm always in midtown Manhattan with multiple cafes offering free wi-fi, 2) I need something bigger than my Samsung phone to type, something more convenient than my tablet (which has a big screen but terrible keyboard), and will be sturdy enough to be thrown into my bag without a case, and 3) it looked like the Macbook Air without the huge price tag. I tried both the Samsung and Acer in store. My friend also had an Acer, which I used for a couple of days for about 4-hour periods. I eventually settled with the Samsung one because I liked the matte screen, the great keyboard, longer battery life and the silver-ness of it. It lasts me a full 6.5 hours when I'm connected to wifi, and when I'm not connected, I'm still able to access my docs on Google Drive offline. It's so convenient and much lighter than my Macbook, which I no longer drag around!

4832,"I'm based in the UK and bought my unit there. However, physically this model is nearly identical to ours (to my knowledge only the keyboard layout and socket you need for charging it differs) and I've been using Chrome OS and previous Chrome hardware for a while, so I thought I'd give my take on this device.I've owned the Cr-48 for a while, which was a kind of test unit Google sent out to people to beta test the operating system. That came out a long time ago and none of the commercial units have felt good enough to me to justify buying, up until now. They were always a little too expensive, despite the obvious advantages.This will be a long review. For those wanting a short summary, I'll include one at the end.The softwareFor those unclear, Chrome OS (which the Chromebook runs) is fundamentally different to a Windows, Mac or Linux-based laptop, desktop or netbook. This is because it runs the web. No native applications exist specifically for this machine. There are apps (sometimes referred to as Chrome apps) but they also work in the Chrome browser.Because this computer runs what many call 'just a browser' it has several advantages, as well as disadvantages when compared to a Windows machine. I've chosen Windows for most comparisons here as more people typically use Windows than a Mac or Linux machine.SecurityYou cannot install Windows applications (or other native software) on Chrome OS. This means that the computer can operate more securely than a Windows machine simply because the computer knows what should be installed. If something is there that shouldn't be there, the computer will erase all local data and install a version of the software that's stored in a secure area. Once you're connected to the internet, you'll be updated to the most recent version of the operating system. As your settings, bookmarks and Chrome applications are stored by Google, they are also restored after the machine is reset and you log in. Typically the operating system is updated every 6 weeks, meaning bugs get fixed pretty quickly (important bug fixes will arrive more quickly) and new features are released quickly, too.Getting things doneThis is where the big problem is for some people; you can't install Microsoft Office, Adobe's Photoshop or other software packages. You're limited to software that's delivered through a website. Most people are perfectly comfortable with using things like Facebook, Twitter and email this way. The web offers some pretty powerful tools, though. For instance, pretty sophisticated image editing software exists on-line, as do audio and video editing tools. Using the massive resources of the internet (typically referred to as 'the cloud') means that video editing and other resource-intensive tasks can be made dramatically quicker than doing it locally. Make no mistake though, if you do need something like Photoshop it's just not possible, unless you use software specifically designed to deliver 'normal' software through the web. Companies like Citrix offer products that can do that, but given the additional cost, it's usually only big businesses that use them.If you don't need extremely-specialised software though, there's a lot available. Google, Zoho and Microsoft all offer tools that will let you create, open and export documents in popular formats, such as Microsoft Office. There are advantages to this approach, too. Google Docs (as an example) allows individuals to use their on-line document, spreadsheet and presentation software free of charge and, even better, you can collaborate with up to 50 people on the same document, practically in real-time. This sort of thing just isn't typically possible with traditional software. Where it is, it's likely to be clunkier than a web-based tool as a website just lets you login and work.Calendars, Angry Birds, finance tools (Sage and QuickBooks are available through the browser) are all also available in this way. It's worth checking out if the things you'll want to do are available in this way before ordering a Chromebook.There are also many off-line capable applications. That is, things that will work without an internet connection. These include Google Documents (editing and viewing) Google Docs spreadsheets (viewing) and things like Google Calendar. Keep in mind though that this is primarily a device for accessing the internet. Without a connection, this device is extremely-limited. Applications delivered through a browser will get more and more capable over time, though.Other drawbacksAs I've said, not everything is available through a browser. Critical things that people take for granted either aren't available or are very different on a Chromebook.It's not possible to watch AVI or MKV video files (at the time this was written) for example, without converting them. That's a big pain for some. Printing is different too, as you can't just plugin a printer on Chrome OS and have it work. For those that are curious, Google has a service called Cloud Print, which involves hooking up your printer to the internet. This approach does have an advantage in that you're able to print to your printer from anywhere with an internet connection, either from a mobile device or any installation of Chrome. For those without a printer that can connect to the internet independently of a regular computer, you can enable a normal printer by installing Chrome on a Windows machine and running it that way.StorageA key thing about Chromebooks is that they come with a 16GB hard drive. This is considered very low by modern standards as a typical Windows machine will come with a minimum of 500GB and often far more.Google Drive is Google's solution for this. Essentially, Google Drive is on-line storage. It stores files from Google Docs and will store pretty much any type of file, too. A key thing is that it integrates with the file system, meaning you can save files directly to your account (Drive can be used on Windows and other computers, as well as Android and iOS devices) and access them from whichever device you're using.By default, Drive comes with 5GB of storage. This isn't a huge amount, but for free on-line storage it's pretty typical. Many other services actually offer much less. However, if you buy a Chromebook you get 100GB free for two years, which is very useful given that it can be used across many devices. If after two years you're using more than whatever the normal free allowance is at that point (things do change) and you've not qualified for some other promotion, you'll no longer be able to add new files. Your existing data will be accessible, meaning files will not be deleted.Another great thing about Drive is that files can be shared with others. Google Docs files are not counted towards your storage.Again, it's worth noting that other great on-line storage solutions exist, such as Dropbox and Box. The difference of course is that they're not tightly-integrated with the Chromebook.Hardware (general)This new Chromebook is running on an ARM chip, the type of processor you'd typically find in a mobile phone or tablet. That may sound slow given the demands of a typical Windows machine, but it's very quick. It boots in around 7 seconds (it feels more like 5 as the logo is on the screen almost as soon as you open the lid) and you can be on-line with your normal tabs open in under 30 seconds with ease. The keyboard is extremely responsive and many professional reviewers have remarked that it's the best that's ever been on a Chromebook, which includes the much more expensive Samsung Series 5 550 machine. The trackpad, too, is very good indeed.The machine is extremely responsive due to it needing very few resources to operate. If you attempt to run 20+ tabs, yes, it will slow down a whole lot. But if, like most typical users, you use this for email, Facebook and the like, you should have no performance issues. Depending on your usage, the stated 6.5 hours of battery life are very close. In fact I'd suggest that you'd get more, depending on screen brightness etc.Other hardwareOn this particular unit you'll find one USB 2.0 port, one USB 3.0 port, HDMI out (for putting what's on your screen on a bigger screen, like a computer monitor or TV) and an SD card reader. External USB hard drives work fine in my experience and many phones are treated properly as mass storage too. However certain devices such as external optical (CD/DVD) drives will not work at all. As a commenter noted, I originally forgot to point out that this machine has no moving parts because of the type of hard drive used. This means the machine is extremely quiet and doesn't get hot.MiscellaneousIt should be noted that since Chromebooks are essentially stateless (that is, they have little personal data stored on them) they can be wiped at any time without a problem and you can start over. This also means that they can easily be shared and Chrome devices (a desktop version, called a Chromebox also exists) have something called Guest Mode, which allows a friend to browse the web without accessing your settings or bookmarks and when they're done, their browsing history is automatically deleted. For those with whom you share your Chrome device regularly, you can add them to the list of permanent users.SummaryEssentially, if you use the web most of the time (this is what most computer users do) or want a second machine that can be used without any technical knowledge for that purpose by others in your household, this is an ideal device. If, however, you like to play a lot of 'real' video games or access specialised software, chances are that this device isn't for you. That said, this device is cheap enough that you can buy one for the couch or to use while you watch television. Due to the price of this machine, it's most likely to be compared to a low-end Windows machine (which are typically very slow) or a tablet, such as a Nexus 7.If you want easy web access and don't care at all about typing, I'd suggest a tablet. A good quality tablet can (at the time of this review) be had for $199, including a high definition screen. But if typing and web access matters to you, I'd seriously consider this device.

4833,"The Samsung chromebook is a solid accessory for laptop users who want a lightweight alternative that provides more functionality than most tablets and smartphones.  The only thing to keep in mind is that this is a connected product that depends on a connection to the Google online services to be useful.I purchased this unit and the Acer Chromebook to assess its use as a supplementary computer for consultants traveling with our company.  My criteria for a good alternative would be based on:-Ability to access and use web applications used by our consultants-Ease of use for a non-technical user-Portability-Reliability-DurabilityChrome OS:  The chrome OS, the interface and the operation of the software on both the Samsung and the Acer are identical.  Setup of the software takes about 5 minutes if you don't have a google account and about 2 minutes if you do.  Be aware that all new Google Accounts are automatically also signed up for Google+.  While I like Google+ some may not want to join yet another social network.  Unfortunately I don't see a way to opt out of that registration at the present time.Since the Chrome OS relies so heavily on the Google internet presence for almost all functionality, Google gives you a 2 year, 100 gb account on Google Drive to use with your Chrome OS (and your other computers).  It is on the G Drive that you will store all the files that you will use with the Chrome OS.  There is a limited 16gb of local storage on the device, but it is sometimes tough to see the distinction between the online/local file locations.  Best to store most files online.Booting the Chrome OS from a complete power off state takes a very quick 7-10 seconds on both the Acer and the Samsung.  ChromeOS logon is with your Google account credentials.  From credential logon to the desktop is less than a second.  If you use the Chrome browser on your laptop or desktop PC and have it sync'd with your Google account, you will bring all the ""apps"", bookmarks, extensions and history to the ChromeOS.  Setup of the desktop is straightforward and shouldn't confuse too many modern OS users.  Communications setup is also easy for wifi.  Bluetooth is available on the Samsung but requires delving into the ""settings"" options.  Applications, the Chrome Browser and other functions are arranged on the bottom left of the screen and pull up using the touchpad.  If you have used the Chrome Browser, GMail or other Google Apps, then you will be right at home on the OS.  I won't spend much time on the Google apps as this is a hardware review, but they work relatively well.  Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, Gmail, Calendar and GDrive can all read and write standard office formats.  In my experience they can adequately replace MS office for on the go work and editing.  More complex editing and design is still best left to the more robust office tools.The Chrome OS is put into sleep if you close the screen and wakes to your last desktop when opened.  However, it does not appear that a relogon is forced after wake, leaving all of your data from the previous session up with your credentials. The Acer will sleep for approximately 24 hours while the Samsung can sleep a couple of days.Battery:  Battery life is much better on the Samsung with a full battery lasting about 7 hours under a good load.  The Acer battery is much weaker at 3 hours.  Samsung's battery is integrated into the laptop yielding a lighter weight and more refined look.  The acer battery is swappable but heavier.  Replacing the Samsung battery would require complete disassembly of the unit, much like the Macbook Airs or Iphones.Speed:  The Samsung is powered by 2gb of RAM and the exynos 1.7ghz processor (2 cores).  The acer uses an intel celeron 1.1ghz CPU with 2 gb of memory.  Memory is upgradeable in the Acer to 4 gig.  Samsung is not upgradeable.  The Samsung handled all loads I put on it, including heavy browser use, VUDU/Hulu/YouTube streaming HD and SD video.  Likewise the Acer was able to handle the same.  Page access and switching between tabs was quick as was access to email and Google Apps.  The Graphics process on the Acer is the Intel HD which should outperform the Samsungs integrated ARM Mali-T604.  However, since neither machine is really for designed for graphics intensive work (games, video/photo editing, etc..), the performance difference between the two is not noticeable.Storage:  The Samsung uses a very meager but fast 16gb of SSD storage, while the Acer uses a standard 320gb 5400rpm HD.  While the extra local storage is roomy, the Acer HD requires more power and cooling and this is noticeable in the shorter battery life.  The Acer also needs a fan to cool the HD and this can heat up the bottom of the laptop and further reduce battery life.  For an OS that requires the internet for use and storage, the larger Acer HD is superfluous.Screen:  The Samsung and Acer both use a 11.6"" screen.  Both screens are bright and viewable with auto adjusting (but defeatable) brightness.  The Samsung screen is slightly more viewable and bright.  The screen on the Samsung is angle constrained by its hinge with a full, flat recline not possible.  The Acers screen will lay flat if needed.Keyboard:  The Samsung and Acer both have unlit keyboards with a standard QWERTY layout.  No number pad on either.  The samsung keys are very responsive, well positioned and have a good feel.  The Acer keyboard is less responsive and has a very cheap feel to it.Touchpad:  Both the Samsung and Acer use touchpads for scrolling and clicking.  Right clicking is performed with a non-intuitive two finger touch/press.  The samsung touchpad is adequate and gives a decent feel of the desktop.  It does feel slightly sticky.  The Acer touchpad is less responsive and sometimes did not register movement.  A USB external mouse can be used on both.Ports: The Samsung gives you 2 USB ports, one 2.0 and one 3.0 highspeed.  The Acer has 3 USB 2.0 ports.  The Samsung gives a HDMI out while the Acer has VGA and HDMI.  Both can accept SD cards.  The Acer has an etherent port (10/100).  The Samsung is wifi only, no ethernet port.  Both Wifi are a/b/g/nPower: Both Chromebooks use powerbricks and grounded cables.  The Samsung has a smaller brick.  Samsung has the adapter port on the back while Acer has chosen a side port.  The rear location of the port for the Samsung is a drawback as it is sometimes a tighter fit when abutted to a wall or work area.Webcam: The Acer has a HD webcam (1280 X 720).  The Samsung has a VGA resolution webcam (640 X 480)Speakers: The Acer and Samsung have adequate speakers for personal listening.  Both have headphone ports.Durability and reliability:  Having only used both for about a month, I can't give a good feel for long term durability.  However having used both out in travel, I will say that the Samsung seems to be the better and more polished platform.  It has withstood some drops overnight in sub freezing temps without any issues. It has a much tighter build and seems to be better able to holdup log term.Weight and Size: The Acer is heavier (3.1 pounds) than the Samsung (2.4 pounds), thicker (Acer: 1.1 inch, Samsung: .7 inch) and less wide (Acer 11.2 inch, Samsung: 11.4 inch) and deep (Acer: 8inch, Samsung: 8.1 inch).  Overall the Samsung has a noticeably smaller footprint and weight, feeling more portable.Printing: Neither the Samsung or the Acer can directly connect to a printer.  Each has the option of using google's CloudPrint to access printers via the network.  Setting up cloudprint can be complex for non-technical users.  An alternative is to use Google Apps to either save documents to the GDrive and print from a full size computer, or save them as PDFs and access the printouts as files.Conclusion: For the additional $50 difference for my criteria I would recommend the Samsung Chromebook.  For the road warrior who wants a backup computing device that has a full keyboard the Samsung is a great choice.  It boots quickly, has a familiar interface and can do about 90% of what a full Windows/Mac laptop does at a fraction of the cost.  It is lightweight, has good battery life and works well as long as it has a internet connection.  I will be making a recommendation to get the Samsung Chromebooks for our consultants.

4834,"Enough people have addressed how this laptop performs, I will try to touch more on the concept itself and help you figure out if this is something you really want to get. My bet is that you will learn to love it once your mind gets past the change in the way you have to do stuffBackground: My girlfriend needed a laptop of some kind in order to write papers and do research on the internet after her old Dell finally bit the dust. After some going back and forth between a cheap acer laptop and a chromebook, we took the plunge and went for the chromebook, and wow what a freakin' bargain. I like it so much I will probably buy one in the near future, even though I have a real laptop.What it is: This is a fast, lightweight and compact productivity tool. This is for someone who is going to browse the web, write, keep up on email and doesn't want to have to worry about viruses, losing their work or worry about breaking their mega expensive laptop. This is also an excellent second computer. SECOND computer.This Samsung unit is typical of chromebooks as it's free of any bloatware and has the perfect hardware to run it's operating system quickly and (almost) seamlessly. It stumbles here and there, but if you don't ask too much of it (like heavy multi-tasking while trying to play youtube videos), it'll run without a hiccup. It's also dead quiet and generates very little heat. The keyboard is excellent for typing,the screen is great, brightness can adjust much more than your average laptop and all controls are as simple as can be.it has USB ports to hook up inputs, it can download pictures from your camera's SD card, You can broadcast video to your TV via the HDMI cable or the chromecast dongle.Battery life is long enough that you will get bored and turn it off long before it runs out of juice.NOW...It's very important while making your decision to buy one that you understand what this ISN'T:It's not a real laptop, you can't expect this to be your only machine unless you're OK with just doing basic online stuff. It's also not a tablet, and you can't expect to run the apps you run on your tablet on this machine, although the chrome store (not to be confused with the play store, this isn't android based) is getting better with every passing day.The chromebook lies somewhere in between the laptop and the tablet. I'm not a fan of tablets, for me they are expensive toys that you use while going to the bathroom or lying in bed. Mostly just time wasters. Trying to type on one for any length of time is annoying, and apple's predictive text system is downright infuriating. You can certainly waste your time on a chromebook too, but you can also do productive things like type documents, upload pictures, hook up an external USB drive and watch your huge collection of movies, and you can also play games.Yes, there are limitations. A chromebook really only works when it's tethered wirelessly to google, because all it's apps are web based. So there are times when it will be a bit neutered, but it retains offline productivity capabilities which mean it's not completely useless. However when you think about it, almost all the big name games on tablets are now cloud based. You certainly can play most games offline, but it's only when you go online that you get the full experience.Honestly, once you take the plunge, the cloud system becomes invisible and you'll end up wondering why you ever did things any other way. Yes there are drawbacks to this, as in someone could hack your account and get your files. But the flip side is that if  you break your chromebook, you won't lose your data. You have to choose your battle. really though, if you're paranoid about your data being saved somewhere other than on your computer, you really ought to re-think reality because all your most sensitive data, including email, financial data and identity is probably already all over the web anyway.There are deal breakers you have to consider when considering the purchase of this little machine:-If you live a rural area and you don't have reliable, fast internet, a chromebook will be useless to you. Get a laptop.-There is no windows on this chromebook, and you will never be able to install it. If you want or need to run windows based programs, get a laptop.I'll put this to you from a different, financial angle: For little more than the price of 2 years worth of insurance for a $600 to $1800 laptop you can buy a chromebook that will take 90% of the duty and wear/tear away from your main computer, sparing it for the essential jobs and prolonging it's life way past the 2 years of coverage.Finally, if this helps you decide, go on craigslist and look for chromebooks, any model. You might be surprised at how few of them are for sale in your area, and you'll also be surprised at just how many of them are being offered at a price that really isn't much better than buying new in the first place.Be brave and try google's new world, I think you might find you like it.

4835,"I picked one of these up yesterday and am using it to type this review. So far, I have been pretty pleased being a tablet/laptop user and not really apart of the cloud scene.First of all, the keyboard is outstanding. It is much easier to use than most laptop keyboards and much easier than touch screen alternatives (obviously). The keys are placed where they should be, are not cramped and have a very nice feel to them. Pretty awesome.Connectivity has been excellent with very little lag. I would call that a non-issue if you have a decent internet connection.The screen, as others have said, could be better. I realize this was only $249 so I have to cut it some slack. Still, it's the one niggling thing I have run into. I hope I can get used to it as the rest of the machine has a lot to offer.I would tell buyers to go for it and keep the receipt in case the screen is not something you are willing to budge on. It's not awful be any means but it nowhere near as clear as my Note 2 and Moto Xoom. Maybe I'm just spoiled:)On a side note, many of the one star reviews here are not really fair. Many of them are from people who bought something without any research at all. This is not a Windows or Mac clone for a low price.

4836,"Had the Samsung Chomebook for 15 Days and the screen already cracked. It cracked in my book bag. Might I add I don't carry text books. Just a notebook and the Chromebook. I bought it at best buy and they wouldn't do anything about it even if it was before there 15 day return policy. Talked to Samsung and even though it broke in my bag they consider that neglect and will not fix it not adding their $50 evaluation fee and $28 shipping fee.Other than that The Chomebook is okay. Has a crappy music player which is Google play and you cant access your library without a connection. Also the screen is so small so unless its a foot from your face, tough luck reading anything.The plus and only reason I bought the device was because it was lighter than my 5+ pound laptop and Google docs is accessible offline.If you are planning on getting this laptop/chromebook get a protector for it and a case because it wont last long. The plastic is not durable and the keyboard is poor quality.If you are unfortunate like I was here is a site and video to purchasing a new screen that you can place yourself. It's cheaper than Samsung shipping and evaluating fee combined.[...]

4837,"Right out of the box this item needs to detect a WiFi source to launch. This it failed to do. It was tested on in-service home networks (self, plus several neighbors), a local library and a Starbucks. Normally I would return and be done with such a product, but the form, styling and adequacy of function as described variously above, are sufficiently appealing to override that initial impulse, and I have opted for replacement. Let's just hope this occurrence has been an isolated event.-((So, coming from Windows, with R and L click buttons next to the touch-pad, I didn't fathom that the touch-pad itself has to be depressed to click, and that a click rather than a tap is required to drop the list of available networks on the start-up menu. Replacement cancelled, and after a couple of hours of use a preliminary review: Attractive design, optimum size and weight with quick start-up and browsing. It is completely satisfactory for surfing, email and videos. (Document composition and editing not tested). The body, whilst tight, might not feel quite as sturdy and unbreakable as one would wish, but if handled properly this should not be a problem. The screen is not the most advanced, but perfectly serviceable nonetheless.In summary, this notebook is very satisfactory as a secondary device to be toted about for basic web functions.))

4838,"Build Quality:Feels high quality (for a $250 computer). It is super thin and extremely light (lighter than most all laptops including ultrabooks), and has a nice keyboard and trackpad that feel very Macbook Air-ish.Software:The software on the Chromebook if you don't already know is Chrome OS. It is built around the Google Chrome internet browser, so everything you do is online, with the exception of offline Google docs. Chromebooks are used to be cloud computing devices. With that being said, if you don't use the Google ecosystem you might not be the most satisfied with Chromebook, because Chrome OS relies deeply on Google integration (Google Drive, Google Chrome, Google Play Music, and pretty much everything Google).Using this Chromebook:My experience with the laptop has been very good so far. This Chromebook is good enough for most daily tasks on the web. (And is as a mentioned above, is a great piece of hardware for the price). If all you want to do is go on the web and you want something simple, and easy to use, then this is a good device for you. The fact that it awakes from sleep so quickly and is instantly ready to go is really great. What you are giving up with a cheap device like this is, is performance. Since it is a lower end device, and the specs are not as beefed up as something like the Chromebook Pixel, you don't get the fastest web experience. Don't get me wrong, websites load very quickly and it is a stable experience, however, the web performance is not quite buttery smooth. Scrolling thru content filled web pages can be a little choppy, and YouTube videos can be stuttery at times, but for the most part, when streaming HD videos from YouTube and other sites such as Netflix, the experience is good enough. Also, Chrome OS does not support full PC or Mac programs so if that is something that you were expecting from this Chromebook, then I would suggest you look elsewhere. I would also suggest this Chromebook as a secondary computer.

4839,"I bought an HP laptop three years ago, and it recently died on me. I figured that the HP would last a bit longer considering I invested so much money in it and didn't use it for much except web browsing, writing documents, and watching movies. Since I am a graduate student, I needed to replace my laptop quickly and cheaply. I didn't do much research before I bought an Asus laptop in the same price range as this Chromebook. It didn't take long for me to return it for two main reasons: processor speed and Windows 8. I knew I didn't spend much on it but the speed was ridiculously slow. I looked into the Chromebook afterwards at a local store, and two different employees tried to discourage me from it. My husband was also turned off at the app aspect of it because it seemed so limiting. I decided to take the plunge and buy it anyway because I've found so many positive reviews about it online. I didn't expect much out of it because it only cost me $250, but it exceeded all my expectations. Here are the reasons:-No updates!: It updates on its own and you don't have to restart your computer in the middle of working.-No virus software to deal with: Again, you don't have to deal with background software that takes away from processor speed.-LONG battery life!: Depending on how heavy the use, battery life can range from 6-8 hours!-It doesn't heat up, so it doesn't need a fan and is therefore, completely quiet.-Super light and portable: Honestly, weighs close to nothing. My husband even says it seems like a fake laptop because its so light-Speed: I didn't think that I could get a laptop in this price range with this speed, but I found one! I can turn off my laptop and turn it back on in a matter of seconds. I've gone from an HP laptop with an i5 processor to this Chromebook and have no issues with speed. I've watched some short videos here and there and found no skipping or lagging either like I found with the Asus.-Keyboard & Touchpad: I never thought much about keyboards and touchpads until I got the Asus and hated the touchpad. It was so slippery and jumpy that navigation was terrible. I immediately fell in love with the Chromebook's keyboard and touchpad. The keyboard could be a bit tighter than a regular keyboard, but it doesn't bother me. The touchpad though is great- precise and LOVE the two-finger scrolling feature.-APPS!: I know some would think this is a negative aspect of the Chromebook, but I have to disagree. This Chromebook already comes with Google docs, slides, and sheets (which replaces Microsoft Office) for free! Converting from Google doc to Microsoft doc is super easy. I even found an app very similar to Photoshop for free! There are so many ""programs"" you can get through apps for free that can suffice. I have to admit that Google docs seems to be simpler than Microsoft Word (no columns feature or colored tables that I could find), but I don't really need all the extras.-Google Drive: I like to email myself my documents just in case I need to edit an assignment on the school computer, but I don't have to anymore. Everything I type automatically saves on Google drive, and I have access to it everywhere just by signing in.-Price: It's super cheap!Some negatives are:-Can't seem to hook it up to my Google Cloud printer, and I'm not sure why. It's not a big deal though because I have another laptop I can print from. By the way, it doesn't work if you connect the printer with a usb, so I think you'll need a wireless printer.-CAPS lock is alt + search button. Again, this isn't a big deal because I don't type in CAPS very often, but it can be a minor inconvenience.-No optical drive. It isn't really an issue with me because I never used the optical drive on my old laptop, but other people might see it as one. An easy solution would be to buy an external one though.-Storage. Most of the storage is through the cloud (100GB for free for 2 years), but actual hard drive storage is only 16GB. I have a TB external hard drive, and I always make it a habit to transfer my files to the external hard drive anyway, so again, this isn't a huge issue with me.I know the Chromebook isn't for everyone, but it's everything I ever needed in a laptop. Please don't be discouraged by the simpler app format if all you need the computer for is web browsing and writing documents. This is by far the best computer I've had because it has everything I need without all the extras.*Update:-Got my printer connected. I never registered my printer to Google Cloud so I had to set that up before connecting my Chromebook to it.-Fixed the CAPS lock issue through the settings (thanks to @Moola Saver's tip)*Update 8/4/2013:It's been about a month since I bought my Chromebook, and it has actually become the primary laptop between my husband and I because of its quick access and long battery life. There is virtually no load up time! We've also watched a lot of short videos on the Chromebook and haven't encountered any issues with it still. Printing, however, is a different story. There is significant lag time between setting up a print job and the printer receiving the message. Initially, I thought there was an error, but it just takes a good minute for the print job to go through. Also, I've realized that some coupon websites I used to visit aren't accessible on the Chromebook. I did some research to see if others had the same problem, and I found a forum that suggested the Chrome OS blocks coupon websites because they download malware onto the computer. I'm not sure if this is true or not, but I just wanted to mention this just in case other people like to print their coupons online. Nonetheless, everything in my initial post still holds true, and I highly recommend this product as long as the buyer recognizes there are limitations. This Chromebook is ONLY $250 (or sometimes less if you catch it on sale)! If you expect more than what this Chromebook provides, understand that you need to spend more!

4840,"I would first like to say that I am writing this review from my chromebook. After doing a lot of research, I chose this laptop because I have a great desktop that I still use for my primary work. As a journalist and a student, I was in need of something I could throw in my bag and take with me to write my stories from a plane or to do homework on the go.The size of the chromebook is great, it is very thin and very light. the screen is small but big enough for what you need on the go, and there is little to no glare. the keyboard is easy to use, although (you might notice a lack of capitalization) i am still getting used to not having a caps lock key and trying to use the shift key. i also am a huge fan of the fact that the computer does not heat up at all. gone are the days of burning laps during an all nighter.the track pad is easy to use, it clicks down, but there is no right click option so that is a little adjustment to remember the shortcuts (ctrl v and ctrl c).As far as the operating system, it is very user friendly. Right out of the box, i was able to turn it on and start working. and the cloud storage is fantastic.i really loved the price of this computer as well. it is very cheap, so if you break or lose it, it isnt as big of a deal as a macbook, and everything is saved on the cloud so if you must replace it, you really dont lose anything (which is the same thing i adore about my kindle).overall i would recommend this to anyone looking for a good computer on the go, but if you are trying to use this as your primary computer device, you may want to think again.

4842,"If you are considering a Chromebook, make sure you know EXACTLY what you are looking for in a device.  If you are looking for something that can play high-end games and run Photoshop, you are looking at the wrong thing.If you need a great second computer that is very portable, runs cool, has great battery life, is lightweight, is easy to type on, has a decent display, and is inexpensive...and you will be using it mostly for web-based applications, this is EXACTLY what you need.That is what I was looking for.  I was pricing out much more expensive laptops when I realized that 90% of what I do on a computer is inside of my Chrome web browser already.  Why would I ever need a $700+ laptop for that...or for that matter, my $2000 custom home PC?Just then I realized that what I really needed is a netbook...but when I think of a Netbook, I think of something like the EeePC.  Too small, too slow, running either Ubuntu acceptably or Windows horribly.This is not that.  This is what the Netbook platform should have always been.  It boots incredibly quickly.  Really, incredibly quickly.  Sometimes I turn it off and back on just for fun.  This is in part due to the fact that it has an SSD Drive as opposed to a platter drive (like the Acer version). With the Series 3 Chromebook, There are no moving parts, meaning there is less parts that can break, generate heat, or consume electricity.The 16GB drive may seem small, but there is a USB 3.0, USB 2.0, and SD Card slot for extra storage.  Additionally, the device comes with 100GB of Google Drive service free for two years.  It does not have an Ethernet port (I have heard some reviews say it comes with a USB adapter but that was not the case for me...though I did buy mine open-box), but the onboard WiFi supports 802.11a/b/g/n, which is just about everywhere now anyway.The chiclet keys are a joy to type on...this is not your dad's netbook.  I type upwards of 100WPM (accurately) and I find this to be a very comfortable keyboard.  Moreso than my Lenovo T520 work laptop.  I do kind of miss having a 'Delete' key, but Alt+Backspace functions to replace this.  There is also (thankfully) no Caps Lock key.  I really hope this becomes the norm.  If it is needed, Alt+Search functions as a Caps Lock.  View it as the Alt key being like a safety on a loaded gun, and think before you scream on the interwebs.The screen is a bit dull, but completely usable.  This helps contribute to the amazing battery life.My Windows computers are accessible using an add-on in the Web Store called ""Chrome Remote Desktop"", which allows you to access any other computer which has both Chrome and this Add-on installed and logged in to your Google account (my understanding is that this is cross-platform, Windows, Linux, MacOS, etc...I have only done this with XP and Win7, however).  I also have found that more advanced users will be able to use ChromeRDP when ChromeOS R25 comes out, which is a more feature-filled version that uses genuine RDP.  With these add-ons, I am able to run Windows applications on my computer at home, for when cloud-based equivalents either don't exist or aren't up-to-par.And yes, it DOES play Cut-The-Rope and Angry Birds.In summary, ignore the naysayers in the reviews all over the web.  People who are giving this thing negative reviews or returning them at your local big box (where my girlfriend found mine in time for Christmas, as an open-box buy) were likely expecting much more or comparing it to real laptops, which is really an apples-and-oranges comparison.  Know what you are looking for and what you need in a laptop.  Think about what you expect to use the device for and, if like me you realize that you are going to be using it almost entirely for web browsing, the Chromebook is a great option at a great price.  And if you feel like you have Windows Apps that you absolutely must have, install Chrome Remote Desktop from the Chrome Web Store on your Home PC, then go to work or a friends house and try to access your PC.  It's incredibly easy and relatively quick, and with Chrome RDP (hopefully) gaining compatibility in R25, the experience may even be better.

4843,"OK - here's my take on this product.  Pros:  Small, light, comes on quickly, is basically Linux with a Chrome overlay (so it's pretty much virus free), great battery life.  Now cons:  Keyboard lacks some pretty vital keys (delete for one), too many keyboard shortcuts (you can't remember them all), touchpad is 'quirky' (and I'm being kind here - it sucks!), screen is dim (even at max brightness), needs more memory and a bigger hard drive (the cloud isn't my favorite for storing personal info).  Overall, if you've never used a computer, this is a nice intro devise.  For experienced users, it's not worth the time or trouble to get (basically) a tablet with a keyboard for around $250.  I got this to see what the spin was all about.  Now, I guess I can gift it to my grandkids come Christmas 'cause I sure don't have a use for it.....

4844,"The chromebook itself is very lightweight, and sufficiently easy on the eyes.  It charges quickly, and holds a battery for an impressive amount of time.  I give the Chromebook three stars for a lot of reasons.  The brightness of the screen is what ultimately ruined the experience for me.  While I'm sure the dulled brightness serves a purpose in regards to battery and the overall price of the product, it is simply an aspect that I could not overcome.  The trackpad is a multi-touch, useful touchpad.. when it works.  I noticed that my interactions with it were choppy, and I got somewhat frustrated.  Once I had the general knack of the Chromebook down, the trackpad had issues keeping up with my swift movements.  Overall, this is a great laptop for first-time computer owners, younger children, or college students who are looking for a computer they can toss into their bag and go.  However, it is not a product that I could see myself using as a sole computer.  The dim screen prevented me from being able to type a paper without getting a headache.  The way a product presents information (aka, screen) and how the user interacts with it (trackpad) are two of the most vital aspects of a product such as this; in my opinion anyway.

This purchase was made on a slight impulse as I love technology and the price is unbelievably good for what you get.  Google Docs and the other office productivity works fantastic with Google Drive.  I never realized how much Google has to offer and am very impressed.  The battery lasts for hours and charges very fast.  The keypad is great and the touch pad is huge which is very nice and works without any glitches or hiccups.  My one complaint is the USB ports are on the back, but it is only my preference to have them on the side.  The SD card slot is nice but I do wish it fit flush, it sticks out slightly.  If you don't know Google (like I didn't) you are missing out.  Give the Samsung Chromebook a good look.  There are some fantastic tutorials on YouTube to show what this thing is capable of.

4846,"To everyone who was waiting for this, I understand you.  I saw this and knew I had to try it.  Amazon just delivered it today and I am typing this review on it.  It has so many wonderful things going for it, but I am probably going to return it for the following 3 reasons:1.  It is too small.  I use a 14"" screen now and thought that downsizing would not be a big deal, but it is.  If you are not ready for a true netbook experience, then do not buy this.  I am not deducting a star for this, because this is a personal issue for me, but I just need a bigger screen2.  Cannot handle printers via USB, must be Google Cloud Print enabled.  I am sure they will fix this eventually, but if it cannot handle a plug and play print job then it loses a star.3.  Chrome Remote Desktop cannot be run from a Chromebook?  What, are you serious?!?  Who fell asleep at the wheel on that one?  They promise to fix this soon, and they probably will, but not being able to share screens hurts business users.  (on that note, Skype works well enough through IMO app that I do not worry about it)4.  The track pad feels cheap.  Most Samsung products are too plasticy for my taste (my mobile is a Razr Maxx) but while the keyboard feels fine and the device is stable, right- or left-clicking feels cheesy.  Another star lost.I have almost no need for Windows or Apple operating systems anymore, I live in the cloud.  That said, this device is just too small and I will most likely be sending it back soon.  I will live with it over the weekend and see if my ideas change.  Most of my work and personal online life is spent within the confines of Chrome, so I assure you I knew what I was getting into.  I want to ditch Microsoft and Apple as soon as possible, but Chrome is still probably a couple of generations away.  Too bad, I did so want to like this.  If I change my mind, I will revise my comments.  If you see no revisions here, then I sent it back, with regret....

4851,"This is my second Chromebook, the first being the previous generation Samsung XE500 purchased last year.  That model had the Intel Atom processor, this on has the ARM chip. I'll compare the two later in the review, which I will try to keep short.Like a lot of other reviewers, I completely agree with the assessment the Chromebook makes a GREAT second computer.  But I'm going to try to make mine the PRIMARY go-to computer.  I like it that much. My current primary is a Mac Mini desktop which is getting a little old and, while it has performed well for years, I'm getting tired of difficult, complicated operating systems in general.Before buying my new Chromebook however, I went to Best Buy last week and bought a Windows 8, touchscreen, Samsung Ultrabook.  After a week of struggling up the learning curve on the new operating system and the hardware I returned it to the store and got my $750 back.  Windows 8 has some beautiful features and the touchscreen technology has its charms but everything else?  Forgeddaboutit!  Good lord, what a complicated nightmare of anti-virus, anti-malware software and constant, lengthy operating system updates.  No doubt I spent more time working on updating and installing software than I did enjoying content.Maybe I'm spoiled by the Chromebook environment which led to my impatience with Windows 8.  But I tried, I really did, to embrace their new technology.  In the end, however, it just isn't worth the effort.Yesterday, for 1/3 the price,I bought my new Chromebook, lifted the lid, input my Google account name and password and POOF, instant familiarity.  All my apps, contacts, calendar and browsing tabs were there, just like on my old Chromebook.  In less than 30 seconds. Then my system said an update was available.  No problem, another 30 seconds.Take that Mac and Windows.So, instead of wasting time downloading yet another Adobe Acrobat or iTunes update, I will spend some free time learning how to get rid of traditional operating systems altogether.  Here's how I tackle some common Chromebook complaints:Printing:  Buy a Google Cloud Print ready wireless printer.  Plug it in, follow the instructions and a few minutes you're printing. Or use Google Cloud Print to access the printer hooked up to your primary home or office desktop.Scanning:  Use the same printer/scanner to scan to a USB chip, then plug same into your Chromebook. Yes, it sounds inelegant but have you ever used scanning software?  Yuk.  Doesn't work half the time. Apple Image Capture is hardly a walk in the park for most folks.  It's much easier to place the document on the glass and press the ""scan"" button.Office productivity software (Word/Excel/Powerpoint):  Use Google Docs instead.  It has all the features 99% of us ever will need.Double Entry Accounting: I thought this was going to get me, but I found a free, cloud-based app on the Chrome Web Store.I could go on and on, but you get my point.  If you look around you can find solutions online that obviate the need for Photoshop, MS Office, etc.  Sure, some of you professional video editors and engineers are going to need your trusty, high-powered software, but not the rest of us.Chromebook Comparison:  The newer ARM Chromebook is marginally faster loading pages and operating in general, but not by a long shot.  The screen is smaller but seems brighter, crisper and renders colors better.  That said, you won't confuse the display on either with a high-end Ultrabook from Sony, for instance, but it works fine for everyday use.  Battery life is excellent in both models.  New model is smaller in every dimension including weight.  But the biggest knock on the newer, ARM-based Chromebooks is the current inability to play Netflix. A solution is still a few months away, but that's not enough to keep me away.  I can watch Netflix on my DVD player or Roku box, so no problem there.I encourage you to buy one of these and embrace the cloud!  Good luck!

4853,"Don't buy a Chromebook to run programs, because it cannot. Here are the only things you can do with a Chromebook:- use a calculator- use the built-in camera- view common file types- browse the internetThe Chromebook is excellent for browsing the web. Websites will recognize the device as a computer (for example, you can watch Hulu shows without having HuluPlus.) Your only browser choice is Google Chrome, but it will always update itself, which is super convenient. Also, I don't think you have to worry about this thing getting viruses, because you can't download programs on it.I bought the Chromebook because I wanted something to take notes in class, but didn't want to lug around a more expensive piece of machinery. The Chromebook allows you to access Google Docs offline so you don't have to worry about not having an internet access.I have had my Chromebook for a year. I use it every day and it still works fine. I would recommend it as an extension to a desktop, but not as a solo computing device.

4854,"Now, before you even start to read this intro, here's the deal: If you are looking for computers that could download games from the internet such as .exe, or .zip, this is not for you. Since this is not compatible with java, you wouldn't want that either if that was what you were looking for. I mean, what were you expecting from computer this price?So the reason why I rated 4 stars, is because it does what I want to do, but lacks a bit. I am a student, that types reports, essays, does charts and whatnot. Surfing the internet, Facebook, YouTube. It does everything I want it to do in this laptop. Long battery life, cool.The reason why I took one star of was because of the printing and the way it stores files. Printer doesn't work. Well, for your average printer that doesn't need wifi-the classic ones-it doesn't. It needs wifi to register. I'd consider checking what printers work on Chromebooks and checking if your printer matches. It wasn't too much of a bother with me because I have a computer, and I could just print it out over the Google Drive. Another thing is the files. The files such as Google Docs or Spreadsheet, they are online files that are stored in Google Drive. What this means is: You can't access your files unless you have it in your Flash Drive. Because this doesn't have hard drive-which can be a pro because that's what allows it to be slim. You could still make filles, and they automatically go to your Google drive once you have wifi.Bottom Line: If you aren't planning for a internet file downloading, and just typing and surfing the web, this is for you.

4855,"I am old enough to remember those computer terminals that sat on people's desks and only worked because they were connected by a wire to another remote machine that actually ran the application software.  I think we called them dumb terminals? Who would have thought that so many years later we would be using something very similar, only wireless, and be liking it.Well I actually do like this Chromebook (and I was one of those people snickering at them a couple years ago, wondering....who would buy one of these?).  Since the price has dropped, and my computer needs have shifted (like those of many people), I actually find myself using this as much or more than my desktop or Ipad.  True, it doesn't do everything, and if you only have the luxury of buying one type of computerish gizmo, then this might not be what you want.  But when I am sitting in my living room, and need to get on the internet, or get to a document on Google Drive (which is sort of assumed you have or will want to have with a this thing), I have a tendency to reach for this Chromebook, rather than my Ipad.  Maybe it's because I'm less worried about dropping it or scratching it, or because it has a real keyboard?The build quality of the device won't win any awards.  The plastic squeaks and bends a little.  The keyboard is pretty good. The screen and track pad are just ok.  But this low price for something that I will actually use regularly?.....I'll take it.....and I hear they will only get cheaper!

Well this awesome Samsung Chromebook (Wi-Fi, 11.6-Inch) does not waste space with these unnecessary keys!Having said that you will need to learn just a little bit about the new key setup. But the efficiency of the whole Chromebook will make up for it completely.I have a Google Nexus 7 Tablet (16 GB) But I needed to have full screen view of websites with the full-blown Chrome browser, this Chromebook delivers that.It is ultra simple to set up. Yesterday I walked into a restaurant with Wi-Fi, opened up my Chromebook and within seconds was online!Do you ever have that dread of opening up your laptop knowing that it is going to take time to setup and find a place to plug in? You will not with this little machine. I really can do some work for 15 min. close lid and walk away without even having to worry about turning it off.Battery life. I love the battery life! I haven't even taken the charge cord with me for the past couple of days.The only negative I would have about this is the size of the screen. Although at the same time that's why I have a Chromebook instead of a 17 inch laptop, I need portability.As a business tool. I would buy this again in a minute! Saying something happened to it, all I have to do is buy another one login and I'm back in business. This means a lot when you're using it as a business tool.I love simple, because simple gets done! The Chromebook is a simple and now essential business tool for me.

Affordable, light and portable, and provides the usage that most users are looking for.I got this laptop a year ago.Optimally, it would have lasted me at least two years. However, something is wrong with it now. I didn't drop it or spill anything on it. Even still, the screen has gone wonky on me. I have to hold the frame of the screen down so I can see anything, and once I let go, it just becomes a blurred mess of pixels. I contacted support but no one really knows what to do besides recommending I reboot the system. Now I just have an unusable machine.I'll still give it 4 stars because of how much I enjoyed using it when it actually worked, but I wouldn't recommend this Chromebook if you plan on bringing it around with you or if you can't handle the terrible support if any hardware problems happen to arise.

Typing Word Or Excel Documents? Web Browsing? Shopping? Do you have WIFI? If so you can do it all for this for $230.00, incredible. Who needs Windows? I do for my business, (but not with this Laptop) yes I need Microsoft Word, also Excel, if you want a great Laptop cheap that out runs any Windows Laptop you have it here. My Word and Excel Solution? Office 365 with Skydrive,  (Or Google Drive with Google Docs )I can do anything in MS Office with this Laptop that I can do on any of my Windows based Laptops. (I can access my docs anywhere anytime with any PC using WIFI) Yes you need Wifi, so what, if you don't have access to it via your Smartphone (Hotspot) or at your home or office this Laptop will be a bit useless, but so wont most others at this day and age..... you can still download docs to this PC and work offline.  Printing using Google Print is extremely easy to setup and use, Google guides you through the process. I run my whole business on it now, haven't used my Windows 8 PCs (1 Tablet 1 PC recently purchased at a much larger expense) or my old XP PCs why? Simply, this runs faster. I let my wife use it....big mistake, had to buy another as she loved it so much she kept it. This is so much faster, the Dual core chip makes this run smooth and fast and guess what? No Blue Screens. I have had this a month, not one crash. It boots in about 15 seconds from opening the lid. Its lightweight, great for travel. I have used it seriously for 5 hours on battery and it still had a charge left. I recommend this highly to anyone who has Wifi.

4859,"Hello,In the beginning I was hesitant to buy this. I practically hunted through these reviews and winced whenever a bad review here and there came up. In the end I bought it since it was in my price range and it seems good. It's smaller than my previous laptop (approx. 15 inch) and really light. Now I am not a GAMER so if you guys are...don't buy it. All I do on my laptop is typed documents, watch videos, surf the net and read. If I wanted to game, I'd borrow my brother's PS3 or something. Anyway as you can see, its perfect for someone who simply does simple stuff. However if you're expecting the usual windows operating system and can't stand change. Don't buy this laptop.This laptop is VERY different. It runs on a different operating system (Chrome OS), you cannot download any programs like microsoft office, photoshop and such. Even the touch pad is different...I guess I am used to my right-click action but this is not a issue to me. Oh yes and if you're a person who is constantly around wifi, that's great. To those who aren't, majority of the extensions and such requires wifi. There are, however, offline packages such as the Google Docs and such so don't worry. Also this laptop does NOT have a CD drive so don't go and buy this laptop blindly if you want a CD drive.Now I'll just throw it in here. I am from Belize (friends brought it down for me). Reason why I say this is because I realize some of the apps don't work depending on your region. For example Google Play Movies, Google Play Music etc. Also if you are the type of people who constantly goes online to video chat with your friends/family the options are limited. Oovoo and Skype doesn't work, the Google Hangout(I believe is the name) I am unsure if it works or not since my Google+ profile got suspended so I'll check back. Now let's review back kids!DON'T buy this if you...are used to Windows Operating System (and/or can't stand change)needs CD Driveloved to play high quality gamesRequires/uses photoshop, Ms Office or any programs.USes other browsers. This is CHROME only zone. Firefox is not allowedUse Oovoo/skype to VC. (Tinychat works fine tho)Don't have much access to wifi (unless you already set up the offline apps)This laptop is different. If you are the type who are already used to the Windows Operating System, MS Office, skype, FireFox, and other stuff. This laptops is not for you.It's a Google product (hence the whole CHROME in chromebook)which uses chrome browser, google apps, and such. And to those who bought it and complained about it because ""Google is trying to trap you"", now if you get to say that then I get to say this ""Apple is trying to trap me by forcing me to use only their programs!! Safari! iTunes! iBooks! Ohmagosh!!!"" You see how ridiculous that sounds? I mean I reread that and I want to punch myself in the face. So do remember this...Read, research, compare then buy. I have read through different reviews (Good and bad), went to other websites, read up through forums, and then read the information provided above. By the time I was finished I understood that I CANNOT download programs that I used before, that I would have to use apps from Google, that if I had no wifi, this laptop cannot do much except use the offline apps. In fact I even used the Customer Q&A to ask what I didn't have the answers for(http://www.amazon.com/there-available-still-usable-documents/forum/Fx2X6TNCJ239Z9U/Tx2R8IV8I6C02WF/1?_encoding=UTF8&asin=B009LL9VDG)I pretty much read through everything in the Q&A...most of the times I would see the same question over and over, does it have a CD drive? Gosh people...look through the questions. So yes it takes hours, but at least I understood what I was getting. To be honest it was a total surprise to me that Oovoo and skype doesn't work but easily I switched to tinychat. But I guess it works because you don't necessarily download it like oovoo or skype.Anyway thank you for reading this dreadful review. Also be nice and don't attack me by saying ""She works for the Devil(google)!!!! If you're gonna say that....well...that's a first.

I have to say that so far I'm very impressed with my Chromebook. It does everything I need it to: go online, use Google Drive, use my blogging service, etc. The only drawback is the lack of functionality while offline. Yeah, I know, it's designed for online use. But there's very little that my Chromebook can do while I'm on a train with no WiFi service.I haven't tried using the Chromebook for music or videos, and I understand people have problems with those, but that's really not what the Chromebook is for.

Instead, they are essentially tablets with keyboards.These are an excellent option for classrooms, or as a backup when traveling and all you want to to do browse the web, check emails, go on Facebook, and the like. I chose these over tablets because of the keyboards and the USB ports.They are lightweight and I find the batteries hold a decent charge. My students really like them. I am able to just give a student one (so portable!) whenever they finish their work before others. They go online to use educational programs, both free and purchased (IXL, SpellingCity, AdaptedMind, Free Rice, etc). They can take their Accelerated Reader tests. All of these programs run perfectly on these machines - they never freeze (as happens on laptops and computers), and respond quickly to commands.My only issue, and it is not a deal breaker, is that I wish they would have more educational apps available. I do use some that are offered. But, there is a limited number offered, especially for the middle school level. I am assuming as their popularity grows, this will be addressed.Overall, these are excellent machines. I am thinking of getting one for my son who just likes to go on the web.

4863,"I had my eye on one of these for a while, and finally picked one up when the harddrive on my Sony Vaio got corrupted.To give a little background on myself and what I need out of a computer, I own my own business and also work in the wireless communications industry. I use a computer pretty heavily in both of my occupations, as well as use Adobe Photoshop and some other video editing software as well. Let me just say if you are concerned with being ""limited"" in your activities using one of these- don't be.There is an app for nearly everything that you could possibly hope to do with a ""normal computer."" Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides take care of Microsoft Office. Pixlr editor is a free photo-editing app that has about 85% of the capability of Adobe Photoshop- and it's free. Tons of productivity and business apps. If you have an Android smartphone and are utilizing any of the Google apps such as Drive, Keep, Gmail, Maps, Calendars, you will find that all of your stuff syncs up beautifully between your phone and your Chromebook. You also get 100gb of Drive storage space for free for 2 years when you purchase your Chromebook, which is more than I will personally ever need. Using drive on your phone you can access any of your stuff anywhere, anytime.Despite some other reviews, I do not personally feel that the processor is inadequate. No hiccups while watching Netflix or YouTube. You can also watch videos/movies saved to an external harddrive, as long as they are a supported filetype. All of the major ones are supported.Sure, it doesn't have an optical drive. There is almost no reason to have one anymore. It is light, it is extremely thin, there are no annoying fans. I will take that over the ability to insert a CD or DVD any day. My fiance that owns a Macbook (that have notoriously nice keyboards) continuously comments on how nice the keyboard on the Chromebook feels.In short, if you aren't a fan of Google, need an optical drive for some reason, or feel the need to download every program that you have to use or use specific programs that there are no alternatives to, this may not be the computer for you. But I would say for 90% of all computer users, for $248 you absolutely cannot beat it.

I did spent 8 hours putting together a power point for a school project and it turned out great and the best part about it is the programs are free and there is no need to buy anti-virus software. It has all the apps and games that one can find on their android smart phone. The biggest con is that many public wifi places are not supported for the Chromebook therefor most schools and many work places will prevent your Chromebook from working.

The keyboard is just like the mac book air it is so comfortable and springy. The track pad is also very easy to use as well. The overall design of this device is really pretty. I think it looks beautiful and its also very light. I did a lot of research on this product, and I know it is a web based system. Really all I do on my main computer is use Google chrome to do all my homework and access apps. I never use exe files at all all my resources are readily available online. So this Chromebook is a plus. I think it is great to carry around in your backpack at school and I am hoping it can last for the next four years. It seems pretty durable even though it is plastic. I love the matte screen because it reduced glare and fingerprinting. It literally looks like a Mac book air from far away. It really does! I really like that as well. I would recommend this product as a secondary computer to use for travel and school work and bringing on the go. You should also have your main computer, like pc mac or something, because I don't think the Chromebook qualifies as a main computer. It is like a tablet but better. On the ipad you cant view like flash stuff but on the Chromebook, it is an ACTUAL browser. This Samsung Chromebook is going to be very useful for me because I use google apps such as Google Drive (the most), google search, chrome, youtube alot. And also other web apps like turnitin and Engrade. I can access online textbooks with no problem. I can use this in the library after school because my school library computers are often always all full after school. And there is wifi at my school so everything about the Samsung Chromebook is a plus for me.9/30/13Even though this laptop tablet thing is just a web browser, It really doesnt feel like im lacking anything.

The pros: it turns on in only a few seconds, it is super light, the battery life is wonderful, I can write documents on Google Docs and do all the interneting I need to. The cons: it is definitely not a laptop. Google Docs and all the other Word-analogous programs are ok, but inferior to Word. There are just so many little things that Google Docs cannot do. I can't figure out how to make my default text anything besides Ariel size 11. I can't copy and paste more than one image at once. If I export a Google Doc as a Word Doc, the margins will be messed up. And, most frustratingly, somehow Times New Roman size 12 font is larger in Google Docs than it is in Microsoft Word, because if I copy and paste something it'll be a different length. Also, be warned: Google Spreadsheets are FAR inferior to Excel. They cannot do trend lines, which is kind of the most important thing that a spreadsheet analysis program does (for me, at least), so that's unfortunate. Google Drive will just NOT sync with my files on my laptop, even when I let it upload for hours and it says it's finished. I have to upload everything directly with Chrome, I can't rely on putting files in the folder that shows up in the My Computer tab. For some reason my mouse will disappear periodically and it takes a few minutes of frantic clicking and/or typing before it will reappear. And my Chromebook is only three months old. Basically, what I've had to do is cut back my real laptop use to just Excel and other programs I need for work, and then use the Chromebook for all the internet and writing I have to do. Which is working fine, and definitely hurt my wallet less than a new computer would have. The Chromebook is great for carrying around and using on the go. But it is not a computer, and the limited functions it has probably don't cut it (as the only computer-like device) for a lot of people these days. The Chromebook probably would be great for kids or older people who only need word processing and the internet though.

The trackpad is comparable to my mac, and operates in the same fashion, so she is able to switch from one to the other without any difficulty.

4872,"I don't write reviews very often, but I really felt the need for this product.I'm currently writing this on my Samsung Chromebook, while on a Delta flight to Cincinnati. The 12 free GoGo passes are an incredible value!I've had an Acer netbook that I've used a lot in the past few months. It was aging, and netbooks were never very good in the first place. I had tried so many distrobutions of Linux on it, I won't bore you with the list. I soon realized the only thing I was using the netbook for was, well, the internet. I browsed the web, checked my social media, and checked my email. I only occasionally played games because the options that would run on that poor computer were few. I then realized that I needed a Chromebook.I had previously rejected the idea of a Chromebook -- the older models  seemed so limited in what they could do, and for the same price I could buy a decent Windows PC. The Samsung Chromebook came out, and I still felt like I wasn't ready to drop $250 dollars on such a limited device. That is, until I realized what I was doing on my netbook.THE DESIGN:I received my Chromebook and was immediately impressed. The size was perfect -- larger than my netbook, yet small enough to carry around. The hinge design is interesting, and to be honest, I don't mind it. It seems to serve a good purpose, as I like being able to have all my ports in the back rather than sticking out of the sides. The laptop is made out of plastic, but the finish feels like aluminum, save for it not being cool to the touch. It is definitely flimsier than a MacBook Air, but it is also 4x cheaper. The design beats my netbook by far, however. It feels sturdy enough. In fact, I even put an Apple sticker on the back to see if I could fool anyone. If I have the Chrome and Samsung logos covered, I can get away with people thinking it's a MacBook Air. I feel cooler as well (isn't that the only reason people buy MacBooks these days?).THE SCREEN:The screen is not amazing, but it is better than I had expected it to be. If there is one thing that is criticized the most other than the operating system on this device, it is the screen. However, people who criticize the screen clearly haven't seen any sub 500 dollar PC's. It beats my netbook's by far. 1366x768 may seem low by today's standards, but remember, many 15"" laptops still have a 1366x768 resolution, and at a normal distance away, I can't see the individual pixels. Viewing angles could be better but it works just fine for the most part. A matte screen is a huge bonus as well, I am actually writing this with bright lights behind me. It is not as good as a MacBook Air, but again, how much did I pay?THE INTERNALS:This laptop is actually powered off of an ARM processor, the same architecture found in cell phones and tablets. However, the processor in this laptop is far more powerful than any phone, and is actually the same processor found in the top of the line Android tablet, the Nexus 10. Specs aside, it is very snappy, certainly far better than the Atom in my netbook. I can scroll across the heaviest of pages with ease, pages render quickly, and YouTube renders at at least 30 frames per second at 1080p. However, playing YouTube in the background while browsing the internet in another tab can be problematic. I suspect this to be more of a software issue than a hardware issue, because this certainly has the power to do both at the same time without the YouTube audio becoming glitchy. Grooveshark in the background works great, making it a better alternative to YouTube for music. Amazon Cloud Player is fine as well.THE SOFTWARE:This is the often misunderstood part of this particular Chromebook. It's so cheap, the pictures look appealing, so people buy them expecting a full Windows laptop. If you look at all the one star reviews, you'll see a common trend: people buying without understanding. No, this laptop does not run Windows programs. No, you cannot install Photoshop. Does it say anywhere in the description it runs Windows? No. Before buying this product, PLEASE understand what it is meant to do. Do not buy it expecting a Windows laptop and then review it as if it were described as a Windows laptop. On another note, Netflix now works perfectly now so disregard reviews that say it doesn't. Also, 100GB of free Google Drive is a huge help when dealing with such small internal storage. The actual software experience is great. Instant on from sleep, and 7 second boot time is amazing. My netbook took upwards of a minute to boot. The user interface is polished and clean. It is very easy to understand. Google integration is really nice as I use almost all of Google's services: Gmail, Google+, YouTube, Google Voice, Google Drive, etc. Software updates come out every six weeks which is awesome. Many of the issues listed in older reviews have been fixed by those software updates.KEYBOARD AND PERIPHERALS:The keyboard is simply amazing. This is the one time in this review I will say anything is at the same level as a MacBook Air. Having used a MacBook Air and this, I can safely say there is no difference. It is not backlit, but that really does not matter for a touch typer like me. The caps lock is replaced with a dedicated search key. At times, I would like a caps lock, in fact I would have liked it better if they had put a dedicated search key where they removed the FN key and kept the caps lock in its original position. In essence, the keyboard is amazing. Mice and external keyboards work just fine, as do flash drives and external hard drives. External DVD/CD drives don't, however. The SD card slot is a nice touch I never saw myself using so much. Using that, I can take my D90's SD card and upload all of the pictures to Flickr (1TB free).WORK/SCHOOL APPLICATIONS:Google Drive works fairly well as an Office replacement. However, if you're looking for better Office integration, Microsoft Office Live (Part of SkyDrive) works very well. Also, if your business uses Zoho, you're in luck as well. I haven't used it for school yet since it is summer, but I look forward to using this laptop in the upcoming school year. Since most/all college campuses have wifi everywhere available to students, I'm sure this laptop's network limitations will not affect most people. I am actually writing this review offline using the built in Scratchpad app. As a sidenote, Scratchpad is the only application other than the file browser that operates outside of the Chrome browser, allowing you to have a mini Stickies style note application.SAMSUNG VS ACER CHROMEBOOK:The Acer Chromebook is pretty much a Windows netbook with Chrome OS jammed on it. It is not optimized for Chrome OS like the Samsung is. It also includes a much slower hard drive, but the processor is Intel and the RAM is upgradeable to 4GB. It is also far worse build quality, has a glossy screen, and poor keyboard. I personally would spend 50 dollars more to get the Samsung as it is thinner, lighter, better build, faster, and more reliable.CONCLUSION:This is an awesome value for me. It is lightyears better than my netbook, and I haven't touched my desktop since I got the Chromebook. It has also helped me get over my Minecraft addiction a little... You really can't go wrong with this as a good computer for home and travel use. I would also recommend this for kids, it is cheap, sturdy, easy to use, and parental control extensions are available in the Web Store, and many filters are available as DNS servers for an entire network. Overall, you can't go wrong for 250 dollars, I highly recommend this to anyone.

4873,"Google slogan on this is on target.  Talked my brother into buying one instead of a regular laptop and he is as computer naive as anyone and yet was able to do everything he needs to do.  I have been a computer teacher and have every type of electronics possible from smart phone to netbooks to tablets and I also believe I was one of Bank of America's first online banking.  That said, I do everything on the Chromebook from spreadsheets to documents.  I do not do any heavy gaming or very much movie watching but for the average person, there is no need to have anything other than a chromebook.  It is quick like a tablet so no waiting for it to load to get busy on work you need to get done.  I know that you need internet connection but that is where I do my work so not a problem and you can make things available offline if really necessary.  I coach also and I do all my practice plans for the 'cloud' and will often then use my smart phone while practicing to see what our the next activity/drill is to be.  I do have bluetooth keyboards for my tablets but the responsiveness of the chromebook keyboard cannot be duplicated on these devices.  In conclusion, a huge thumbs up for this machine!!!!

4874,"There is a lot to talk about in relation to the Chromebook, and I think many people have done a fantastic job of reviewing what they love and don't love about the Chromebook. I will skip a lot of that - yes it's sleek, the keyboard is great and the screen is reasonable for personal use, but I wanted to share some of the things that currently do, and potentially would make this an ideal laptop for a lot of people. These are some minor things and some major things, in no particular order.For Chromebook information, compatible accessories and tutorials on installing Linux, head over to: whatthetech.info/samsungchromebook----------------------------Now you may be surprised (even horrified) to know that I sold my Macbook (5,1 - aluminum) to buy the Chromebook. Of course, I made a nice profit after trading in a $500 used laptop for a $250 new one, but many would consider this a huge downgrade. I did so for several reasons.1) I'm quite heavily invested in Google's ecosystem. I use Gmail, Google Docs, Google Calendars and almost every other app they offer in my day-to-day life. No I don't like their privacy policies, but the services they offer (for free I might add) are just amazing! The Google Drive free 100GB offer was also a huge draw, as I had just run out of dropbox space, and really don't feel like paying money for ""storage"" that I would only use part of.2) I realized that about 95% of the work I do is web-based. Seriously. I am a photographer by trade, and so I can never be entirely without a real computer, but apart from that all I do is blog, write articles, review products and browse the web. Having a hackintosh desktop means I can (and do) run any OS, and I can always do my real work there. I rarely (and I mean almost never) have to do work away from home, so this was not really an issue. Also I would say 95% of the places I hang out (home, cafés, friend's places, even my church) have high-speed wi-fi. Being cloud-based, Google's OS is very limited without wifi. The good news is, there is support for playing media, managing files and certain apps offline, so if I don't have wi-fi or am not willing to pay for it (airports), it's not dead!3) The macbook was just not a great laptop to run Linux from. I tried multiple things, but for some reason it was just a pain. Support for the network card was spotty at best, the bluetooth would lag my mouse, the trackpad was difficult to work with. I just wasn't impressed. Now while there is no official support for Linux on the Chromebook, but some clever folks have already created a version of Ubuntu that can be run directly from an SD card (tutorial at the aforementioned link). I have two reasons for wanting to run linux; the first is to be able to use the Tor browser safely. The second is to have a safe environment in which to learn some Unix (yes I know OSX is based on it, but it's different). The chromebook is ideal for this because you can return to factory settings without too much hassle, and with much of your data being cloud-based, you simply sign in to a new installation and wait for a few small apps to download!Now there are a few limiting factors to the functionality. Here are some things I would like to see change/happen with the Chromebook and ChromeOS:1) Widgets. I'm going to start with the most controversial one, and that is the ability to run widgets. Now I'm not talking about some monstrous hardware monitoring widget that spans half the 11″ screen (although I would be interested to see a few stats), but I wouldn't say no to a clock, Gmail monitor and perhaps a few other little helpful apps. In Ubuntu I have a few nice ""applets"" that don't take up much screen real estate or resources, but allow me to tweet, check the weather and get email previews without opening an app (per se, yes I know the apps are running in the background but you know what I mean!)2) The ability to rearrange the app launcher. Despite being able to reorder apps in the launchbar, it is not possible to rearrange apps in the app launcher window. They are arranged by date downloaded by default, however this leaves the stock apps at the top of the list/on the first page. At least the app launcher will open on the page last scrolled to (unless you restart), so I don't always have to scroll around for my most-used apps, but not being able to put my most-used apps first is a minor annoyance bordering on a real issue. *UPDATE* David left a comment on this review letting me know that this feature has been added to the dev channel for future release - this is great news!3) Simple scrolling with a mouse. I have been using laptops for about 15 years now, and I've never quite gotten used to only using a trackpad, so I like to travel with an Apple Mighty Mouse in my bag at all times. That said, when I hooked up my mouse (which was a very easy process), I noticed that despite being turned on, simple scrolling wasn't working. I tried a second mouse to be sure, and the issue was replicated, so I'm filing this as a bug and hoping Google can get a fix out. Aside from this minor issue I have found using a mouse (and the trackpad) to be a very nice experience!). *UPDATE* See bottom of review!4) Better page caching. Perhaps in an effort to save space from being used by the cache, if you leave a tab unclicked on for a short amount of time, you will have to reload it when you click on it again. Now granted, this is only a two-three second delay in accessing my information, but if you happen to be somewhere with a slow internet connection this can be a real pain. I am very glad for services such as ""Read Later Fast"" which allows you to save a webpage to read at your leisure (also this works in offline mode), but on the go the reloading of pages can be a little annoying. I have noticed that this doesn't happen all the time, and it doesn't happen with every web page. If anyone could offer some insight, I would be much obliged!5) More control in the file manager. When accessing the built-in file manager, you are immediately greeted with two sidebar folders: Google Drive and Downloads. Now I am very glad for my free 100GB storage, as well as the option to make files available while offline, however as someone who is particular about their file management system, the inability to place folders on the sidebar for easy access is a little frustrating. All I want is to be able to make an audiobook folder, an images folder and a folder for current word documents, and have them be quickly accessed...nothing too much to ask?6) Charging port. For goodness sake, this is about the worst design I have seen on a charger to date. Not only is the charging jack fragile, but it goes deep enough inside the laptop that a knock is going to bend it or worse! At first I thought that Apple had sole rights to chargers that maintained connection through magnetism, but it seems that Microsoft also successfully patented a similar design for their surface tablets, so I don't think it's outside the realms of possibility? Nothing has happened yet, but I keep having to look over at my excitable dog...just in case... :)OVERALLA portable, well-performing laptop who's limitations are easily fixed in future generations. I like ChromeOS, but I LOVE running Chrubuntu Linux on the device. I can easily use it for watching videos, listening to audiobooks and music, as well as blogging and word processing. The battery life is good, the screen is decent, and having USB 3.0 and HDMI are a real boon. I definitely recommend you give this a try - it's a cheap way to get a decent laptop, and you might just fall in love.Despite the pitfalls, the price and performance left me feeling that four stars would be just too harsh. I really do enjoy my Chromebook, both under ChromeOS and Chrubuntu, and on the plus side my wife no longer wants a more expensive macbook - she'll be getting a Chromebook soon!- Written on a Chromebook-------------------*UPDATE* - So I spoke to a ""Chrome Ninja"" (a.k.a. customer service rep) about this issue and got a very interesting response. The first email I received stated ""The Simple scrolling feature is currently only available from the touchpad of the Chromebook. This is not a feature that will work with any USB devices."" Feature? I would call having to switch the way you scroll an annoyance, not a feature. Perturbed, I didn't answer back. In a subsequent email (telling me they were marking it as closed), I voiced my opinion, saying ""Does it mean (only) that it's not a feature right now, or that it will never be? I wouldn't even categorize it under ""features"" per se, I would consider this more of an OS shortcoming. Is there any way to report this as a bug?"". A few minutes later, ""Joe"" replied: ""This would actually be best described as a feature request."" Again with the whole feature request thing. Joe was polite and attentive, but I strongly disagree with his statement. Not being able to mimic scrolling across multiple devices seems like a whole lot more than a ""feature"" I should request. I'm not going to request it - I'm sure they'll figure it out eventually.

4875,"This is seriously the most surprising laptop I've bought. For $250 you'd think eh, it'll be ok. However this bad boy has surpassed every expectation. However you must know what you are buying. This is NOT A TYPICAL LAPTOP.I was already well versed in google docs and chrome browser so it was a seamless transition to the chromebook. If you have never used google docs or chrome, do yourself a favor and trying downloading the chrome browser on whatever computer you are reading this and start using google docs. Try it for a week ONLY using Chrome and Google Docs, if you are able to survive with everything you need, I would buy this laptop.If you've already bought this laptop, you have to try this... hold alt+ctrl+ /  and you'll see ALL the shortcuts making this thing even more awesome.The best thing for me is that they keep updating it. What it may not have had a month ago, it will have with the next update. As Google continues to roll out updates, this little laptop automatically updates itself. Hence, even if you don't have all the features you want, its only a matter of time before it gets there.Now that's more dealing with software issues, the hardware on here is a bit limited. The screen will always been a less than magnificent screen, but for the price you can make a few concessions. Also, the feel is a bit plasticy, but if you have any of the samsung phones, you might already be used to this feel.My final thoughts, this thing has gone above and beyond what I thought I would need it for. It has replaced my desktop computer in many ways. The only thing you need a desktop for now is for photo and video editing and occasional sound editing. But since that's not what I use my laptop for, I love this thing!

4876,"I have had this chromebook for 3 years now. Use it for everything from streaming movies to school work, best $275 I ever spent hands down. I have noticed a slow down as far as loading goes the last several months but severe and still loads fast enough.Only issue I have had in 3 years is the SD card ""door"" broke quite easily (doesn't effect the SD card in anyway though) and the headphone jack chipped so sometimes sound plays out of the computer speakers and headphones simultaneously. That's it, cosmetic things, definitely worth the price.

4878,"I loved this little Chromebook, and for a few days, after I brought it home, it started freezing up, over and over, and the only way to get it unfrozen was to turn the whole thing off, and then back on.  I tried ""googling"" the problem, and read that other people were having the same problem, the freezing up, and then having to reboot, sometimes four times an hour.  So I returned my Samsung Chromebook, and tried the Acer Chromebook.  Did the same thing.  I tried different settings, (beta), and I know my wireless was working ok in my house, as my tablet and kindle worked fine.  But it continued to freeze up, constantly.  So I also returned it.  I'm hoping to try getting one, again, in the future, and that whatever this glitch is, will be gone, as I really loved it, just right for me.

4879,"This computer is absolutely perfect for web-related stuff. It's NOT a game machine. It's a little workhorse that helps you get stuff done without the distractions. Great for writers who just want to be able to access their documents, emails, and research on the web.  I haven't had a problem with Netflix or Hulu. YouTube runs smoothly. The sound is impressive for such a small machine.  Spotify's beta web player also works really well.  You can't bog it down with a lot of games and programs.It is NOT, however, for someone who has to have Microsoft Office installed. It's also not what you're looking for if you want to get a fairly inexpensive machine for kids -- unless you want them to focus on their homework instead of gaming.

4880,"Lightweight, fast, looks like a Macbook Air (lol). I bought this for school purposes but I ended up replacing my original laptop with this all together. Its SO convenient.Now just for laughs and giggles I'm gonna say what would make this machine absolutely unreplaceable.64gb storage.1080p Screen.Back-lit keyboard.Speakers on top of the device, not on the bottom edge. (Probably better speakers too)That tegra 4 chip everyone is talking about.Maybe a few accessories like keyboard covers/skins and hard shell clip on cases.Basically everything the macbook air has that this doesn't lol (except the tegra 4 chip).But for a lightweight and very very portable computing machine, this beats the macbook air easily because of the price point.$250 > $1000 anyday of the week. Especially for web browsing and especially using this in public places. If this were to get stolen I wouldn't be as bummed out since everything is backed up all the time and since it was only $250.If you're looking for a computer just for basic computing such as web browsing, netflix, youtube, word processing, then this is the computer you should get. If you want to spend an extra $750 for the macbook air then go ahead im sure its better but I am extremely content and very happy with my purchase.

4881,"I agree with pretty much everything the other five star reviewers have said. There's more than meets the eye and, the Chromebook, in spite of not giving you access to Windows applications, more than makes up for it with a great selection of Chrome Apps, the wide accessibility of consumable content on the web and portability. Plus, for the first time, I'm using I'm using a trackpad that is so well tuned, that I'm not missing my mouse at all.The Chromebook redefines portability and takes the ""laptop"" into the realm of what users iPads and tablets experience every time they lie down with their toys on the sofa to browse a website or read a book. Only, with Chromebook, it's not just a toy. You get the advantage actually being able to do email and get real work done. Having a real keyboard makes a huge difference and, as one reviewer put it, makes the Chrome both a device for content creation and content consumption -- that you can actually prop up sitting cross-legged without fear of blocking an air vent and causing a blue screen due to overheating.I own two Ultrabooks. When I acquired them a year ago, I had imagined that I could use my laptop in every room of my house in any kind of sitting position. No way has that been the case. I can't even put it on the bed because it'll overheat. I had imagined that when I opened their covers they would boot up in 7 seconds. Yeah...at first it did. But now Windows has reverted to the mean and made this ""souped up"" hardware with  their SD drives feel like it's 1999 again...without the party. I'm not kidding, it takes at least one to three minutes for one of my Ultrabooks to boot up. I had imagined that I could toss it on the sofa without damaging it. Maybe I can, but I'm not going to risk it.Now, I get this satisfaction finally, with my Chromebook at a fraction of the price of a Macbook Air. At $249 it feels disposable and I mean that in a good way. It takes the edge off the paranoia about dropping it or losing it at Starbucks (make sure you set up password protection to awaken from sleep).If there's a drawback, it's a minor one. The keyboard, while spacious, slightly stiffer than I'd like. But other than that--this truly probably the best bit of technology to come out since the iPad.UPDATE AFTER USING IT FOR TWO WEEKS:It turns out that this this Chromebook is the only one out several other versions made by Samsung and HP which does not have a fan or vents. To me that makes a big difference in that it essentially un-tethers me from having sit in front of a desk. Plus, if you research Google's high-end Chrome Pixel, you'll find that even though there are no vents on the bottom, it does have a fan that blasts out the rear ""piano hinge."" The fact that I'm sitting here cross-legged on my couch writing this confirms, I've made the right decision.

4882,"Pros: Fast, easy, convenient, maintenance-free. All the functionality I need in a non-gaming machine.Cons: Not having full, Windows-like driver functionality for all-in-one printers.No Delete key.Other Thoughts: I'm sold on Chrome OS for my work needs. I don't fling red birds or waste time on social media sites, but I do use Google Drive and the Zoho office suites extensively. I do some light photo editing and create line drawings as necessary for my job.I like having access to my files from anywhere. A huge bonus is not having to concern myself with updates, patches, anti-virus software, or even software installation.As a technical writer, I'm used to my keyboard layout. I can deal with no Caps Lock key, but I need my Delete key. Not including one makes no sense. It doesn't quite smack of Microsoft's arrogance with regard to Windows 8, but the ""Google knows best"" attitude can take a hike. I've gotten enough of that attitude from the other two major players. I can safely say that -I'm- the only one who best understands my computing needs.The unit itself is zippy and easy to set up and customize. When the second-generation Chromebook Pixel with Intel's Haswell processor hits the streets, I intend to buy one--but only if the keyboard sports a Delete key.

4883,"If you are broke as heck and just want a computer for light web browsing and MAYBE some simple coding through one of the available Chrome apps like Caret or Tailor or Quickfire, it will work for that. Otherwise, this machine is basically cheap garbage you have to be very careful with or you will break the buttons and the screen in no time. And it scratches very easily.My wife bought this computer when it first came out and within mere months, it had a huge scratch on it and a broken key. Her trackpad also doesn't work well. It almost never clicks the first time and it can't seem to make up it's ""mind"" if you should press fully down to click or just tap it to click. Basically, to click a simple link, you have to click and tap 3 or 4 times minimum.Knowing this, I was extra careful when I eventually got mine for a very cheap price ($61!). It is worth about that much, but not even really. You would be wiser to save that money and invest it into a real computer.Due to the flimsy plastic case, the screen broke within 3 months when I held the very lightweight thing by the plastic edge of the screen rather than the base of the computer. And I've been being extra careful, remember! Also, even after being very careful, there are several light scratches on the back of the screen and I have no idea how they got there. I thought my wife was being rough with hers, but apparently not. I literally open it up, place it on the table, do some Facebook stuff and close it back up and set it aside WAY in the corner where nobody will ever accidentally touch it. Oh yeah, I almost forgot: my trackpad doesn't click easily, either. Same deal as my wife's: you have to just click or tap and hope it works. Usually have to try both 3 or 4 times. Working on this machine feels like walking on eggshells. I type very lightly and I always treat the trackpad with ultimate respect. First, I try the light tap to click, then a click, then another tap and a click, never following through with a click that seems too forceful. I tried pressing harder a few times and it doesn't work, so pressing harder probably just makes it even worse. Comically, after a forceful click, what I always discovered is that the computer reacted to a light tap instead... so this is why I say it seems to change it's mind a lot about whether it prefers you to click it or tap it. It's like playing against an opponent who keeps moving the goal posts and has hidden traps all over the playing field.So, the screen broke due to the flimsiness and I ordered a replacement screen through Amazon for fairly cheap ($38 total) which now brings this piece of garbage of mine up to almost $100...So, the new screen arrived with a dead pixel and when I replaced it, it appeared that the previous owner had also replaced the screen once, which is probably why he cut his losses and sold it for a mere $61 after realizing it was a junk computer... which is something I would almost consider doing,  but I don't think anyone is interested in these older generation Chromebooks now, so I'll just keep it in the living room for Facebook use. I would not buy the new Samsung either because I'm sure it's just as cheaply made.All this is good for is casual web surfing. Very carefully. If you throw this in a backpack, it is going to get damaged quickly.I installed Ubuntu when I first got it, but there was not enough power to do anything, so I wiped the computer back to it's defaults. I have installed Caret and Tailor and Quickfire, which are all cool, but considering traveling with this thing will break it, I'm not inclined to take it with me anywhere and try to code in a different location. I'll just stick with SublimeText and my iMac.

4884,"I've been a Google Chrome user since the day the beta was announced and released. I've appreciated the simplicity, the fast javascript performance and synchronization features. When Chrome OS was announced I scoffed at Google's ""vision"" for mobile computing, but over time I warmed up to it. This is my very first Chromebook, sadly I was never able to get a free CR48 when Chrome OS was in beta. I was interest in the new ARM Enyox processing architecture which allowed a cool quiet way to access the web.Cons:Chromebook arrived, booted it up. Took awhile to update but once that was done the first thing I noticed was choppiness and lag. It just wasn't smooth. Screen was washed out and a bit grainy but honestly I wasn't expecting anything more for the price. But the speed and snappiness that is synonymous with Chrome just wasn't there. Flash stutters on some websites, heavy html5 websites stutter, angry birds stutters (hey doesn't that game run great on like a 2nd gen iPod touch?). I actually suspect this might just be an optimization issue as the arm architecture underneath powers some pretty advanced devices today without a hitch. But I honestly couldn't recommend this Chromebook for dedicated flash gamers or heavy video watchers or someone who likes a lot of tabs open. I understand Chrome is a compromise in features but they should try harder not to compromise the performance either, even at $250 I'm still holding Google accountable for not fully delivering an authentic Chrome experience. I did install Adblock Plus and Flashblock to cut down on webpage bloat and it seems to have helped.Pros:With simplicity comes serious security. This is probably the premiere banking terminal you could buy. Linux underpinnings, sand boxing and integrity monitoring, zero viruses. Though I will say this wont protect you from phishing scams so always been on the lookout for those.The keyboard and touchpad integration with the OS is very good. Touch gestures, dedicated keys for back, forward, refresh. Chromebook has an Apple-like hardware/software integration that allows for a pure experience that what you see is what Google intended for you to see, unlike Windows PCs and the bloatware that accompanies them. This perfect union of Google and Samsung is still made painful by the fact the Chromebook could use a little power boost underneath the hood.100gb of Google Drive with native support on ChromeOS built right into the file manager itself. This renders most complaints about a 16gb flash drive moot. You just got $100+ in high end cloud storage for free! That alone sets this device into a ""buy it"" category despite performance hiccups.If someone steals it, you'll only cry for around ten minutes versus the entire day if it were a Macbook AIR. This is a cheap piece of tech. Though if you're like me $250 is still a lot of money you're still gonna be pretty upset if it's taken. But hey, what would you rather take to a cafe and peruse the net while drinking some coffee? A Macbook or a Chromebook? And that's the beauty of this machine. It's a great portable buddy with low risk.Summary:This device is like if someone thought ""Hey the Macbook Air in concept does a lot of things right, except the part where most people use 5% of the features and pay 7x more than they should"". It's got the thin, sleek design and the Chrome logo is a little bit of a fashion statement in its own right. However Google in it's quest to mainstream their excellent piece of software took a little bit of the nitro out of that powerful engine in order to keep prices low. What happens is that you're getting a browser that more often than not sputters at any website with complexity. Part of me thinks the hardware in this device is more than adequate and Chrome OS 24, 25 will be further optimized to bring back some of that bang.If you're looking for the pinnacle of Chrome or Google's fast HTML5 vision for the future you're not going to find it here, but if you're looking that sweet piece of ""good enough"" computing without the bloated price tag and maintenance of the big boys, you've found your nirvana.

4885,"I've had the Samsung Chromebook for about a week now, and it continues to impress me every day. I have always been a Windows user, and never thought that I would switch, but I'm glad I did, For starters, this laptop is extremely light weight and very portable.The battery life lasts me over 6 hours, with the screen brightness all the way up. It powers on faster than a Windows machine turns off when you pull the plug from the wall, and when you wake it from sleep mode, it is ready to use in about 2 seconds. The screen is very clear and the keyboard is comfortable and easily usable. The track-pad is also pretty cool because it offers a variety of features and is very responsive. I was a little confused before I bout the Chromebook because of the idea of saving everything ""in the cloud."" This is actually very easy, and is no different than saving to a hard drive; except now, all of your files are password protected, can never be lost, and are accessible from any computer or smartphone. With the Chromebook, you also have the ability to work offline; meaning creating and saving files and documents offline. Even if you do not have an internet connection available, you are still able to create a full document, and save it locally on the hard drive of the computer. The Samsung also easily connected to and detected my 500 Gigabyte external hard drive, an SD card, a flash drive, and my wireless mouse and keyboard (for when I use my laptop like a desktop when working on large projects.) The transition from windows to Chrome was surprisingly easy. The Chrome system is incredibly simple to use, and doesn't have all the clutter that windows has. Another great benefit is that Google Doc's, Sheets, and Slides (the equivalent of Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint) all come pre-installed and are completely free, for life. The Samsung Chromebook is also extremely fast, and I mean in every aspect possible: Starting, waking from sleep, powering off, opening web pages, multi-tasking, opening app's, and anything else you want to do. With the purchase you also get 100 Gigabytes of free online storage for 2 years, and you always get 5 Gigabytes free.This Laptop has become the only computer I use, totally eliminating the need for a tablet, and almost eliminating the need for a desktop. The only downfall is that there is no disk drive, and I am not sure if an external disk drive will work or not (I intend to order one and try it out.) There are also many (probably thousands) of App's available to download to expand the power of the CHromebook to endless possibilities.

4887,"sometimes, you need a powerful PC with software, anti-virus, a 5 minute boot time, and other nuisances. Such is my main desktop work computer. But sometimes, you just need a blazing fast web portal to take care of web stuff. That's what this little chromebook does. Up until now, such a thing hasn't existed. I've used the little acer netbooks and they are slow, bulky, and cluttered with features their tiny slow processors can't handle. And the iPad just doesn't have the horsepower (and keyboard) for what I need ... for example, iPad has mobile chrome, not the ""real"" chrome.So, this little guy fills the product slot that didn't exist but that we desperately need.I love it, but taking a star away because it's build quality is an 8 out of 10, not a 10 out of 10. That's OK, for $250 it's worth it.

4888,"Bringing together the technology of an iPad and a laptop, the Chromebook by Samsung is a very helpful tool to anyone who doesn't need an entire laptop and just wants to use their computer for e-mail, word processing, and anything that can and will be done on-line.The Samsung brand of Chromebook is extremely hearty. I dropped mine off the couch, it bounced across the room, and landed on its side. Part of the back popped off, easily clipped back on, and the Chromebook did not suffer any problems whatsoever. I highly recommend this particular Chromebook because it is built like a cinder block, not a bone china dish.My only complaint is that, despite having 16GB of RAM, you cannot download a film to watch while on a long drive or aeroplane ride. I feel like we should be given the option to download films if we can afford extra memory sticks.+This is a great tool for both small business owners like myself and for those who enjoy having the internet on the go without having to drain the battery on your smartphone.+The battery life is amazing. It truly does last between eight and ten hours,+This model is sturdy and great for those of us who either have children or just have The Dropsies.+The screen has a beautiful display and is a great size for watching films.+It is so light and slim that it can fit into just about anything-- I carried mine onto the aeroplane in a plastic bag that also carried a snack-sized bag of Teddy Graham's.If you are looking to buy a Chromebook this early in the game, this fairly priced, sturdy piece of technology is the perfect choice.I cannot recommend this highly enough.

4889,"Don't buy this expecting it to do everything Windows does at half the price. It is missing a lot of common functionality and that could be a show-stopper for a lot of uses. I'm not kidding at all about that. If you absolutely need it to do something non-web related you might find it useless.I use it for the ssh client and normal web browsing. The ssh client is also missing a lot of common functionality but I eventually found a way for it to work in a way that I don't mind.The Chrome Remote Desktop allows me to control a WinXP machine pretty well. That allows it to interface with Windows applications if there's another computer around.But, what it does do I find it to do very well. Since that includes everything I need, I'm very happy with it. Main advantages (for me): no fan, no spinning disks, no power supply hum, nice keyboard, fast boot, very fast shutdown, few system annoyances and popups (none?), quick wifi connects, light weight, doesn't get hot, good battery life, low price.I've had it for a few months. If it breaks, I'd get another in a heartbeat.If you're thinking of installing a custom OS, you should know that you'll have to use the Chrome OS linux kernel, AFAIK. Please correct this if that's untrue.

4890,"I purchased this laptop for about a year now and really like it. I stream Netflix regularly, listen to music, and do all my internet surfing.  The sound is better compared to other laptops I've had--it really is excellent considering this is such a lightweight laptop.  I like the charging cable position and design--I've had no problems with it, but it does seem a little flimsy.  Only issues I've had is I haven't figured out how to print with my somewhat older (canon MX80). So I use my desktop to print.  The headphone port doesn't work well with my earbuds (no sound or sound only on one side), but works great with 'regular' headphones.  I really want to get one of these for my mom but that bad reviews are discouraging.  I highly recommend this laptop based on my experiences with it

4891,"First off this laptop is very good and fast enough for my use at least. I am really enjoying the fact that it is very light. The fact that it does not have a caps lock button is something that I will have to get used to. I do like that it does have forward and backward buttons and a refresh button. The screen is very good and clear. I love the over all simplistic of the computer. This is not to say that there is little you can do with it as the case is just the opposite. The number of apps that you buy to do everything from watch films on Netfilx to writing schematics is truly increasable. Over all I am very happy with my buy and I would happily do it again. The only thing is that if you do not like the Google interface of how Google drive works than you will not like this laptop. This should be elementary but I will say it any away. I got mine refurbished and it came quickly and no sings of use at all.

4892,"Bought this used(in great condition) for under $200, and its hard to complain about for a price like that, but I'm going to anyway.Pros- - Price - Keyboard is fantastic - Extremely light and thin - No fans!! - Rarely even gets warm - Battery Life (consistently get 6+ hours) - Great trackpadCons- - Viewing angles (I had read before purchasing about bad viewing angles, and laughed those complaints away thinking that would not bother me.  But the viewing angles are truly awful.  You have to keep the computer in one position to see the correct colors.  Any change, even by an inch or two completely changes the screen, different colors, gets very washed out) - It freezes, alot.  If I use the computer for a few hours per day, I'll probably have to restart it a 2-4 times.  I debated returning it because of this, but if it does freeze it only takes about 15 seconds to get back to exactly where you were.  When getting back into chrome you just hit ""restore pages"" and you'll be back to the place you were when it froze.  Very frustrating but I think less frustrating than going through the return/exchange process. - Not enough playback sites.  Netflix and Amazon Instant video not working.  I knew this when I purchased about a month ago, but was hoping that they would have those sites working by now. - Video Playback.  When I switch to HD on youtube, the processor can barely handle the load and ends up pausing and freezing a good amount.  That is 720p, 1080p rarely works.  I know its not a problem with my wi-fi because my ipad 3 can handle the same things with no problem. - The screen.  This is a minor complaint but the screen(when viewing at the perfect angle) does look pretty washed out.  I was hoping this was the only CON I really noticed when purchasing this, because for $250 that one thing can be completely overlooked.  But with all the other problems this is just one more thing to tack on.  Looking at this, and then using an ipad with a retina display, just makes me appreciate how great the ipad screen really is.Overall-This is really a 3 star product to me.  By that I mean, I'll keep it.  I think on a regular basis that I should return this because of the problems, but then I'll use it for a few hours without freezing, and type something up(like this review) and be very happy with it.  Chromebooks can and probably will be great soon.  I really like the ARM processors because of the lack of fans, noise, and heat, but am missing the muscle of intel.If your looking into buying this, just be sure to know Chromebook limitations.  Also, do not expect something fantastic with such a low price point.  I had low expectations going in, and still ended up disappointed.  But overall, it's good enough to keep around.

4893,"I was so excited to get my chromebook for Christmas, yet have been nothing but disappointed. The unit has never worked properly, continually crashing, reseting, and not connecting to WiFi. I have tried all available fixes, including searching online for help. I have installed updates, reset the device, restored the device to factory settings and nothing works. It continues to shut down and reset itself every few minutes, making it not usable. I finally resorted to returning it to Amazon, and found it past the return date, with no customer service to help make it right. I spent $250 on a big paper weight. I am dissapointed that Amazon wont help to replace a defective product.Update: I sent it back to Samsung and they refused to help. They claim my "" 3rd party charger"" (which I had to buy right after, because the Samsung one broke) CAUSED my problems... Nevermind that about 1 million other customers have the same problem. It's all over the Internet about the crashing problem... Do they all have ""3rd party chargers"" too? No. I bought Samsung instead of acer because I trusted Samsung. No more... They have lost me and everyone I can pass the word to as a customer.

This usually happens when I watch youtube videos for more than 25 minutes. I don't know if youtube's site is really the problem or not but after restart and logging it, it seems to be fine. The restarts happpen about 3-4 times per week with daily use. There's not much to the chromebook or the OS so i'm not sure what i am doing wrong here.The build quality is fine but expect thin, cheap plastic.

The only thing we have tried to do on it so far that was a problem is access video conferencing for live lessons through school or webinars from various vendors because you can not download and install the items needed to this device. I have also had people say Skype works now but I have been unable to figure that out so far but thats fine since we have other devices for that and google hangout works just fine as a replacement. One problem I have noticed is if I put too much pressure on the left side of the device it will not function properly. It took me awhile to figure it out and was upset at first thinking it really was a piece of junk that I would have to return but once I realized I was creating the problem I adjusted my positioning and haven't had any additional problems.

4896,"I bought one of the cheap chromebooks for Xmas last year.  Seemed great at first:  easy setup, opened almost instantly, fast downloading.  BUT it was downhill from there.  The cheap hardware is a problem:  some keys stick, other keys have to be pushed extra hard, typing too fast makes it jump to another page, overheats in a few hours and locks up.  It's streamlining means it's missing some keys; you have to remember and use combinations instead.  This includes the delete key--kind of an important key for me--very irritating!  When it gets hot after a few hours, weird things happen, s.a. when I use the touchpad, the whole page moves instead of just the cursor; the cursor keeps changing shape and function on its own; can't scroll up and down; finally it freezes and google has to reboot.  This is the worst computer I've ever owned!  Speed is its best quality, but that doesn't count for much when I have to turn it off because it keeps freezing.  If you want a cheap computer that you only want to use for an hour or two at a time, chromebook may be fine, but for surfing for hours, don't waste your money.  Get something better made.

Starts up in seconds. (You must have a wifi connection, okay, I use my phone as a hotspot if I cannot pick up a signal). Online in seconds. You can operate with ten tabs open, but I try not to go over five tabs. Two for my blogs, two for social media, and maybe one wild card. Those of you who appreciate all that google offers, will most benefit from this computer. Those of you who are mobile, and need a lightweight computer which is also surprisingly sturdy. My chromebook has fallen twice from a height of four feet to the ground, and my heart jumped into my throat! It withstood the abuse. Writers! this keyboard and setup rivals mac airbooks. I took my chromebook into a mac store in portland oregon, last february, and the employees there were amazed. The pricetag comp is hundreds of dollars saved. Netflix and youtube enthusiasts: guess what? This baby hooks into flatscreens with the HDMI port, no problem. Pandora enthusiasts? I have my Harman K tuner connected through the headphone jack with a 2:1 cord through the video 3 out. I can play google play and pandora through my system that way. If you are on a budget, you will not be disappointed. Bloggers, no time wasted with Windows updates and antivirus scans.

The is my secondary computer; I have a desktop where most of my heavier work is done.I've found the Chromebook to have a long battery life, and it boots up and shuts down very quickly.  Any minor word processing that I need to do on this computer can be done via the Google Docs app.  I've also had no trouble with video conferencing via Google Chat, Hangout, etc.Chances are that the Google Chromebook won't be your primary computer (even though it could be for a few people), but I don't think it was designed with that in mind.  This is a laptop to have with you when you just want to hang out, watch TV, and BS on Facebook/Twitter/etc in the process.I'm rating it five stars because it fits my needs, as described, extremely well.  If you are looking for a computer that packs a more powerful punch, or if you need to do much above social networking and minor word processing, you may do better by looking elsewhere.

Lastly what makes thing awesome? The price, you get so much for your money and you can buy 4 of them for the price of one ipad.  And really, are ipads that great? Sure they are, the keyboards for them cost almost as much as the Chromebook. Don't be fooled by online, go to a Best Buy or find someone, that owns one first.

I do some light photo editing and create line drawings as necessary for my job. I like having access to my files from anywhere. A huge bonus is not having to concern myself with updates, patches, anti-virus software, or even software installation. Off-line functionality is getting better, and all indications are that Google intends to improve in that area.Two weaknesses are: 1.) Not having full, Windows-like functionality for all-in-one printers (and CloudPrint in general), and 2.) No Delete key (which may or may not bother you).As a technical writer, I'm used to my keyboard layout. I can deal with no Caps Lock key, but I need my Delete key. Not including one makes no sense. It doesn't quite smack of Microsoft's arrogance with regard to Windows 8, but the ""Google knows best"" attitude can take a hike. I've gotten enough of that attitude from the other two major players. I can safely say that -I'm- the only one who best understands my computing needs.The unit itself is zippy and easy to set up and customize.

I do a lot of photo editing but I didn't need a laptop for that, that's what my desktop is for. So the Chromebook is primarily being used for viewing websites, Google Docs, and travel usage. While you can't install programs there are plenty of apps in the Chrome Web Store to take care of a lot of needs. I was already ingrained into the Google ecosystem so the learning curve was minimal.Initial setup is simple if you already use Google services. Boot up took only a few seconds and it is super quiet. I logged in and it imported all of my settings, games, apps and bookmarks from my Chrome browser. Battery life has been really good so far even with the screen at max brightness. There also has been no issue with the heat like there usually is with standard laptops.It's important to know that you have to have a wifi connection to use all the functions of the Chromebook. There are offline options for a good amount of the built in apps but for the most part you want a wifi connection to use it to its fullest. If you need a desktop replacement or have specific programs you need to use then this is not the device for you. There may be apps that can function similar to your programs but make sure you check the Chrome store first.

My main use of this computer is to browse the web while listening to music. When I first got the computer, it connected immediately to my Bluetooth speakers and I was very pleasantly surprised because other devices that I own would only sporadically connect despite me setting it over and over again to search and find the device.I have probably done 6 software updates since I got the computer and with each one, problems began to occur. The Bluetooth only connects sometimes and if I have the device a foot away from the computer and try to connect this Chromebook to it, all I get is ""Failed to connect to Bluetooth device."" There is no explanation why. It's very frustrating and I've given up on trying to use it and am stuck with the tinny speakers on the laptop if I want to use it while sitting outside. It was terrific when it actually worked.The bigger issue is that the computer randomly freezes, the screen goes all psychedelic and then the computer restarts. And all I'm doing is reading a web page. I know these machines have low specs but a browser window that's displaying text threads (message boards) is not-- or should not be-- putting pressure on the machine, yet the freeze/restart will happen at least five times an hour while using it.I thought this would be the perfect machine for sitting outside and browsing the web but at this point it has become entirely too frustrating. The only responses to these issues on the various forums is that there is something wrong with my home wireless and that is causing the restarts. There are six other machines on the network here, all wireless and they have never lost connectivity and restarted or indicated that they have gone offline.

Well, how great is that big hard drive when it fails suddenly and you lose docs and photos?  I have been spending some time transferring all my docs and photos to the cloud, where they will be safer than my hard drive.  WiFi is everywhere I go, so they are always accessible to me.  It's the future.I can learn to live on the cloud.  I will figure out the printing and the music.  I do miss skype, so I put it on my phone instead of the laptop.  You have to be flexible.For this money, and this speed online, I can be flexible.  So far, I am very happy.But yes, I have a big desktop at home and I will always have one.  It carries my software requirements, I have a weather station.  I also had a big external hard drive, with a million photos and tons of music.  It failed.  Now I can only hope for data recovery.  It's time to go to the cloud.I travel with the chromebook.  Travel is all i do.  If it breaks after a few months or even a year or two, I will be here criticizing the durable factor. I have a company issued ipad. They have beautiful displays.  Forget typing on them.A couple of weeks later:Well, solving the printing thing was not very easy.  I got a new Canon, Cloud Print Ready, printer/scanner. This printer was specifically listed by Google as a printer that would work with Google Cloud Print.But even though it was set up for Chrome Cloud Print as an option, I ended up on the phone with tech support.The printer found my home network ok, but then it didn't get a IP address.  So I just got an error message.  Had to reboot printer and my home router.Perhaps it was just a fluke. Also, not necessarily Google's fault, but not sure.I put the printer software on my Windows desktop so I could scan stuff at home.I can print documents from my Google Drive on the chromebook, but not DIRECTLY.Instead of going to the doc and hitting print (that gave me the hated ""Aw Snap"" page), I have to go first to the Google Cloud Print page, designate my printer, and start there.Then it lets me browse to a doc on my cloud drive.Well, I guess that's doable.  It's just another learning curve.  The cloud print software will probably get more refined at time goes by.My spouse has a different chrome book and I WAS able to share my print setup with her so she can use my printer from her Chromebook.  She printed cooking recipes from the web to the cloud printer, and it worked just fine.

4915,"I've had my Chromebook for a semester now and while its not my main computer it works great for being my travel computer.  I'm on Christmas break right now and took this home instead of my 12 lb laptop.  I remote into my main laptop when I need to use a program or access certain files but most problems with files can be solved with Google Drive if used correctly.I also discovered a little thing that allows the Chromebook to be faster.  Its called SWAP and basically partitions part of the SSD to be used as RAM.  This is where I found out about it:  [...]I've been using it with 2GB partitioned off for several weeks now and have noticed much less lag when having multiple tabs open simultaneously.

4916,"I've had my Chromebook since last spring. I read many reviews before I made my purchase, so I already knew what I was getting. I have a Windows 7 desktop and 2 Sony laptops, so I really didn't need my Chromebook for the functions for which I use my regular computers (mostly image and video editing). I needed a fast and simple path online and something more portable than my laptops, but still with a full-size keyboard. My Chromebook was the perfect solution. It starts almost instantly, and I'm online before my other computers are finished booting. It's very light and perfect for travel, and I have been getting more than 6 hours of use from the battery-- sometimes even 7 hours. I'm very happy with the suite of Google applications included. I had never used GoogleDocs before, but I found it easy to use, and for me, preferable to Word. I like that I can export from the Google applications to Microsoft applications if I need to, but mostly I simply keep my documents online in my GoogleDrive-- which I also love. With the Android GoogleDrive app on my phone, I have access to my files all of the time. The Chromebook is fast enough when I am surfing online, and I have never had any problems-- even with watching HD movies on Netflix. It is very convenient that the Chromebook has 2 USB ports (1 USB 3.0), an SD card slot, and an HDMI port. My USB ports instantly recognized my terabyte portable drive and every other USB storage device that I connected (also my wireless mouse, which I prefer over the trackpad). The HDMI port means that I don't need any other device to stream movies to my high definition television. I simply plug in my Chromebook into a TV HDMI port, and I'm ready to go. The Chrome operating system has been much improved (as promised) since I bought my Chromebook. Originally, the picture viewer would frequently hang up when viewing a large number of files, and the movie player couldn't play .AVI movies from my external drive without sputtering and skipping frames. After several automatic updates, both issues have been completely resolved. (The music player does not play .wma files, so you will have to convert them to .mp3.) I'm very happy with my Chromebook. It has delivered everything that it promised.

4917,"I had already cut the umbilical cord to most MS products so converting to this product was perhaps easier for me than most. I was also already using the Chrome browser. But I debated this purchase because there were a few programs I still used on the PC.I finally convinced myself to buy because I could run those programs (or equivalents on Linux). Well it turns out, I have found everything I needed in the Chrome OS universe. I think with a little looking, many of you also will find there are different ways of doing things, and maybe like me, you will find the different ways are even better.I'm giving this a five star because I'm pleased as punch with this machine. The only very minor problem was that initially it was difficult to get my headphone's plug in and out of the headphone jack. Also the machine at times seems a tad slow serving pages compared to my old laptop.I travel a lot so the tiny weight of this machine is a major advantage.I love the design of this machine. When Chromebook first came out I was really disappointed that the initially models were just as heavy as PC laptops. I was waiting for this machine for several years.I'm looking forward to buying a new machine in two years (hopefully Google will still offer free cloud storage with a purchase.)The only change I'd like to see is metal body. I'm not sure there is a market for this but I would certainly be willing to pay more. Samsung has produced an elegant, fully functional, machine at an incredible $249. I'm extremely happy with my purchase.

4918,"First off, this laptop is best for a specific type of person. Some people simply won't be able to use this laptop. For example, people who...-aren't familiar with using anything other than local storage (like cloud storage)-who need to do lots of offline work-who are very dependent on the capabilities of Windows or Mac-who aren't flexible with changing operating systems-who aren't comfortable with using computers in general...probably won't want this laptop. However, if you're like me, you'll absolutely love it. I'm someone who previously used Windows 7, yet I was using cloud storage as my primary storage anyway so that was a great switch. (Plus, the extra 100gb you get with this laptop is a nice extra.) I need Microsoft Word for school alot, which makes people turn down this laptop quite often because you cannot install it, but most people don't know that you can easily access the real Microsoft Word/Excel online for free at skydrive.live.com, with all the features you'll ever need. Chromebooks also come with Google Drive, which is another word processor that is easier to use but limited compared to Word. Since a chromebook can do little offline work, it's a concern for some people, but I don't see a huge difference between this and my other laptops in that sense. There are multiple apps that allow you to work offline. Still, I'm almost always hooked up to WiFi, whether I'm at my house, at someone else's house, at school, or in a coffee shop. The look and feel of the laptop is fantastic. It is very tiny, which makes it easy to carry- and it's light, too. I've noticed lots of weight has been lifted from my backpack. It almost resembles a Macbook Air because of the clicky black keyboard and the thinness. The trackpad is fantastic in my opinion, and has a satisfying click, again resembling that of a Macbook. The desktop has no shortcuts, which I love because it just looks cleaner than other laptops. All of the settings are easy to access through the toolbar and a handy row of buttons above the keyboard.This laptop was perfect for me, but before you buy it for yourself, make sure you can easily work primarily on the web without huge fancy programs being installed on the computer.

4919,"First off, let's just get this out of the way.  If you come to a Chromebook expecting a machine to run the latest games on or with expectations that it will do the same things as a $500 Windows laptop, you've come to the wrong place.That said, if what you are looking for is a reasonably well-built lightweight machine that provides solid basic applications at a low cost, this is a great choice.  Yes, it's just a machine that runs ""just a web browser.""  But if you let that limit your view of what's possible, you're missing out.Even inside Google's ecosystem lies enough power to provide most of your needs.  A good solid word processor, a spreadsheet, a usable ""forms"" application for basic databases, and even a presentation graphics package.  Throw in Google Mail and Picasa, and what else does a novice computer user need?  Facebook, YouTube, and even some of the video services (although, because of its reliance on Microsoft Silverlight, sadly not Netflix) all run beautifully.  It also does a fine job of playing local media stored on a thumb drive or even a small hard drive.Even advanced users will find something to like about this Chromebook.  It's super lightweight, all solid state, and the 6-hour battery life is perfect for a ""second laptop"" around the house or for the long excursions where carrying a full-function laptop is too much weight.  Samsung's build quality is fantastic, especially for such a low-cost product. I'm a systems administrator, and it makes a perfect go-anywhere SSH and RDP terminal at a low-cost and light weight.Chrome's ""offline mode"" does a superb job of letting you use Google Drive's features without needing a full-time net connection, so much of what makes this a usable machine doesn't need a tether to the network to work.  As more and more applications are developed to support ""offlining"" (which is not just limited to Chromebooks) this will only improve.No, it's not a replacement (yet) for a full-function computer for everybody.  It is a great starter machine for a novice user, or a second machine for a more advanced user that's willing to accept that World of Warcraft isn't happening on this machine.

4921,"There are three manufacturers for the Chromebook: I chose the Samsung Chromebook as I have a Samsung mobile phone, so I knew I'd get a good product. Previous comments that this is an worthy competitor to an iPad are right: but I think this is actually a more functional product.I'm not as familiar with the Chrome OS as I am with Windows or iOS but I found it easy to learn and utilize Google Drive to up and download docs and pics. I was already a gmail, You Tube and Blogger user, thus no additional need to learn those apps.My only criticism of the Samsung Chromebook would be the outer silver shell. I pride myself on taking very good care of my electronics, but after a week the silver shell has numerous scratch marks on it: one of those 'look at it, and it scratches' type feelings. That's very disappointing which is why I give it 4 out of 5 stars. Otherwise it's an excellent value for the money item.

4922,"I bought the Chromebook as a writing tool, but also knowing that I would use it for all the many web based behaviors I have developed. It works perfectly for the way I use a laptop, is way more useful than trying to write on a tablet, and it's just right for carrying around. The keyboard is really nice to use.The Chromebook is not pretending or trying to be the latest, best, fastest, most techno bit of up to date soon to be out dated device. It is not a brand new shiny Apple that will be old news in six months, it is not the latest and greatest Windows whatever,it does not have the most advanced screen, and so what, everything on the screen looks good to me. It is a simple, functional tool that is very reasonably priced and works incredibly well, and what else does it need to be?
            "
4923,"I can see this laptop being reasonable rated either 4 or 5 stars depending on the user. Although the laptop is limited by what it can do, it does exactly what it is designed to do with excellence.The smallest laptop I'd had before this was a 15"" Macbook Pro (MBP). After 4 years of rough use, it has a cracked screen and a battery that needs replacing. After I got glass in my hand from opening the screen, I realized it was time for something new. While the Macbook Pro probably booted in 30 seconds or so when it was new, it now takes a minimum of 45 seconds, usually more like 1 minute. It got hot when I had more than 3 or 4 apps open (albeit high energy consuming apps), and the battery life quickly eroded from about 4.5-5 hour charge to 2 hours max if I kept the screen brightness at one notch.Enter the Chromebook: the screen is not big, but its big enough. It isn't particularly fast, but its plenty fast enough. The screen is the perfect size for this computer: it is meant as something portable, easy to carry, and easy to search the web or edit a document. Its great for my because if I start feeling lazy, it really isn't what you want to watch a movie on, only because the screen is big (although the resolution is still very nice, I checked it out).It definitely only has 2gb of ram, and if you have a nicer computer, you'll notice the very brief lag. My desktop has 32gb of ram and flawlessly switches between web pages, applications, etc. With the Chromebook, you will occasionally see a 0.25-0.50 second  lag, but its nothing that impinges functionality. On occasion, I can type ahead of it, but again only by fractions of a second before it catches up and keeps up to my pace. When watching netflix or youtube videos, you may get a stuck image, but it is quick to catch up and move along (this is on 100MB/s wifi, so it wasn't the internet connection that was the problem).The front camera is plenty sufficient. Video chatting is easy and the microphone is good. The downward facing speakers are.. strange, but they do still provide plenty of sound. I have no intention of this computer serving as a speaker - anywhere I use this, I'll have headphones in, so speakers don't really plan much of a role for me.The battery life is similarly outstanding. On the Macbook Pro, I was always annoyed that the lowest backlight setting was still way too bright. It would hurt your eyes at night and was just generally annoying. The Samsung Chromebook dims down much much further, and still has about the same brightness as a MBP on full brightness. This is nice because when I'm sitting in a dim room, I can practically put this on one of the lowest brightness settings and battery life is outstanding. Similarly, the extremely quick start up means that once you finish working and need to leave, you can shut down the computer and preserve battery life. After using the computer for 4 1.5 hour segments, I currently have an estimated 2 hours of battery life remaining. For my MBP, I would have need to recharge at least once already, and I'd probably be on the verge of dying again.The only downsides I can mention: one is obvious, it is limited. If you need frequent access to Photoshop or another application, it will get tiresome connecting via Remote Desktop all the time. The speaker is not great, but honestly its fine and for a $240 laptop that does everything I've asked it to, I'm glad Samsung realized that laptop speakers are used sparingly and aren't an important feature. Last, the blacks aren't deep. If you want deep blacks, plug into the convenient HDMI cable on the back of the laptop and connect to HDTV :)Also, I'm 6'4 with pretty large hands and I was worried about the keyboard being too small. This has not been my experience - the keys are about the same size as any keyboard, but a lot of the periphery keys have been removed so you just have the letters, numbers, three buttons on the right, four on the left, and a row of specialized buttons at the very top. The track pad size is cut down, but still very usable (although I plan to keep a mouse because I don't generally like trackpads). The track pad is not as good as the MBP I had, but its good enough.Build quality seems good. The casing fits tight and is secured by nice, big screws, not the tiny ones that break and fall, never to be seen again. The screen stays firmly shut when closed. When I close it and the screen is about 2 inches from closed, I feel the spring-loaded action force the screen closed. This is a feature I do not notice on any Dell laptop I've ever used, or Mac product really. Its laid out simply and efficiently, just like it performs. It is very light and very portable.Final verdict: If you can work with Google Drive and Chrome all day, this product provides premium value given its very low cost. Its hard to believe this sells for less than a smart phone or tablet with all it is able to do.

4924,"I received a chromebook from my parents for Christmas because my other laptop was big, clunky, and was damaged from being thrown in and out of my backpack through all of my travel to/from school. Let me just say that for the price, this is an INCREDIBLE little machine. BE FOREWARNED - if your school e-mail accounts are Gmail, DO NOT register your chromebook with your school-related gmail account because you will not have full functionality of the machine - you will not be able to download anything from the chromestore. Make a separate professional gmail account first.The chromebook is worth it for recreational use - not entirely practical or effective for getting real school work done, but great to have for breaks between classes so you don't have to wait in line at your computer lab. This is the perfect laptop for freshmen and sophomores whose assignments will likely be more research based and include a lot of paper writing. Don't expect TOO much as far as media is concerned - streaming is pretty slow and there aren't really any fun games that come with it.It's affordable on a college budget. Great for regular web browsing, it's lightweight and very portable for frequent packing/unpacking when on campus and I LOVE the keyboard. The camera is reallllly lacking and is one of my biggest functional complaints. There's really no reason the camera has to be this low quality/res. You can save documents in google docs as a word document which is convenient for writing papers while on the go so you can go back and edit them on your chromebook later or on a different device. Battery life is incredible - totally not a concern.For my educational needs unfortunately this laptop does not fit the bill. I'm a business student and a lot of my classes require frequent use of excel which by itself isn't a huge deal, but I do have to download various non-microsoft operations management programs which aren't available for chromebook and therefore, I can almost never do any of my upper-level course assignments on my chromebook. While you can open word docs and powerpoint slides, the text and images can be distorted and shift position in the document. When creating documents, the word doc in chromebook is smaller than a word doc on a regular desktop computer by about a line.If you're looking for a tablet/laptop hybrid - chromebook is perfect and at a perfect price, but the chromebook cannot act as a substitute for a laptop or desktop computer.

4926,"First I'll review the Chrome OS and then I'll review the Samsung Chromebook.ChromeOS is brilliant. For those desiring a definition of ChromeOS, it is the operating system that you interact with when you use the computer. It's like Windows, Mac OSX or Ubuntu. Windows has a Start button - ChromeOS has a Google button.ChromeOS is designed to get the user to the Internet and not much else. And it does it well. 10 seconds after pressing the power button I am accessing the Internet. 3 seconds after opening my laptop from suspend, I'm accessing the Internet. It's very fast.It's very easy to use. If you are comfortable using the Chrome Browser, you will be comfortable using a Chromebook. They are very similar.I know Windows, I know Windows Server. I know Ubuntu. But it's nice to use a device that's just simple to use. You thought a Mac was easy? This is easy.If you want to do more than access the Internet with this device, you'll want to look elsewhere. This is a great second laptop or computer. If you have a desktop at home, you may want this as your laptop because you can remote into your desktop when you are out and about.If you have Microsoft Office on your desktop, you can use it from the Chromebook because the Chromebook has a Remote Desktop application.Chromebooks and Chromeboxes are the perfect device for a desktop support person who has to manage lot's of devices where users only need to access the Internet. Think Schools, Libraries, Kiosks, etc. These devices can be managed - in the IT sense of the word.If you are concerned about losing your laptop and losing your data on your laptop this is a good option. Since you can remote into your home or work computer, if you lose your Chromebook, your data remains safe.So why have I given this device 3 stars you ask? Well, I probably would give it 3.5 stars if I could but Amazon doesn't allow half stars. The reason I haven't given it more stars is that it's not exactly what I want. It's close but it's not quite what I think it should be.I looked at the Asus 1015 and the Acer C7. In my opinion, the Samsung comes closer to what people want than these other two devices. The other devices are bulkier. I don't need a VGA port. I want my device to be thin. I really like the 6 hour battery life I get with the Chromebook. The other devices are much less than that. The Chromebook is lite. My daughter recently asked to borrow it for a presentation at Church. I asked her if she wanted the ThinkPad instead - it's more robust after all. She said she wanted the Chromebook. I asked her why. She said because it's lite. She said ""it's like a tablet but with a keyboard."" In a way, I suppose it is.The think that I don't like about the Samsung is the build quality. It's not bad, it's just that it could be better. Do I really need a 3.0 usb port? I'd rather have a more solid device. I wish the plastic was more durable. I'd like to see a polycarbonate body. The one thing that really bugs me about it is that the keyboard dips a bit in the middle towards the screen. This really bugs me. (If it hadn't had this issue, I would have given it 4 stars.) I went to the local retailer that I purchased this from and they pulled another one out of the box and it had the same issue. I think the plastic bottom didn't have enough time to cool in the factory or it wasn't pressed correctly.So there you have it. Enjoy your new Chromebook.By the way, my Chromebook fits perfectly inside ELS-111BLACK:Case Logic ELS 111 11 Inch Chromebook

This lead me to want a computer that was light, portable, fast, and good battery life. This computer contains all of those features, along with many more. My favorite thing is the remote desktop. I can hook up my chromebook to my other computer that has to stay plugged in and control it. It is perfect for when I go away and need to update a document or get a photo. I would say it would not be a good choice to get if you are looking for a computer that would totally replace a pc or mac. The battery life is about 6-7 hours. I do have to say some bad things. First of all I have noticed that when ever I open the lid sometimes it needs an extra 3 seconds for it to connect to the wifi. It is not a huge problem but is something I would like to mention. Also when streaming videos it can skip a little/ buffer. I do not know if that is the exact term but that's how I would describe it. Overall I really like this computer and love how fast and portable it is.Pros:~Portable~Easy to use~Fast~good battery life~good amount of apps~boots up fast~Cheap~3G version you can get 2 years of 100mb of free data.Cons:~buffering some~can have issues with wifi (sometimes)

4928,"After using this computer for almost two years, I can certainly say that it's an excellent computer performance-wise. Chrome OS does absolutely everything I need, and is quite intuitive.The actual computer is very nice. When I first got it in January 2013, I realized how slim it really was--which is VERY slim. It's a plastic computer, so it can't be expected to look fantastic; however, it's sleek and slim, and it's fairly durable.Less so in the first year of using the computer, but now prevalent nearing the end of the second, the computer's components pop off easily. There aren't exactly many screws keeping everything together, so when I'm fidgeting with the computer, I often find that I'll have popped part of the monitor off or something like that.The Chrome text next to the logo has slowly faded away, and the back of the computer has become very scratched. The bottom of the headphone jack has broken, and the SD card slot cover has become unhinged.Now, for a $250 budget Chromebook, enduring two years of use, this certainly was expected. It performs better and is more durable than any Windows computer in its price range. Although I'm not entirely impressed with Samsung's construction of the computer, it works. The Chrome OS is wonderful, being consistently updated over the past two years. The computer has not slowed down, nor has the OS felt outdated. It's an operating system continually evolving and becoming better; and for most people, that's something they want.

4929,"I have had the same HP laptop for 3 years. Like all Windows PCs, it has slowed significantly overtime and the battery has begin to fail. I cant make it more than 45 min on battery and besides that, it is heavy. So I always kept it on my desk and I spent a good 4 hours a day working on it as a Web Engineer. I also am a full time student so I need it for writing papers, doing hw online, making spreadsheets, etc. I was always using a flash drive to carry my files around campus and to work. I can say that I am an advanced computer user and I spend a lot of time working on a PC.I purchased the Samsung Chromebook over the summer, and I have only opened the HP laptop once since then. And that was to see if it still worked so I could sell it.Google advertises these as a supplementary laptop, and I think that is a mistake. There is no reason not use this as a primary laptop for 90% of people. I think that there are a lot of misunderstanding concerning Chrome OS that are limiting the sales of these. In addition there are several things aspects of Mac and Windows PCs that people are not willing to break away from due to a brainwashing of advertisements. I am a firm believer that people should use what works for them, so please don't look at me as a snob. I would like to address some ideas that I have heard tossed around by electronics consumers, because many of these ideas are misleading.1. This computer is not powerful enough for my use!So many people are used to seeing Intel core i5's sold in PCs, that the idea of any weaker processor will make their machine useless. This is simply false, I can stream videos online and use multiple apps simultaneously. Windows PCs need strong processors and more RAM because they are running so many background processes as part of the operating system. For the ChromeOS, there is no need for so much horsepower. (although new Chromebooks (Acer C720, HP 14) do offer this)2. I need Microsoft Word and Excel! If I don't have these I can't do my work!You can use FREE WEBAPP VERSIONS OF MICROSOFT WORD AND EXCEL ON SKYDRIVE.LIVE.COM. For whatever reason, nobody knows about this. If you have never tried these before, I strongly encourage you to open a new tab and go to skydrive.live.com right now and sign up. These are free versions of Microsoft Software, produced by Microsoft  available at no charge. I understand that documents need to be created in the Microsoft format, but for personal use only docs, I have come to prefer Google Docs formats because they are lightweight applications. I only see the tools I actually use in the applications.3. I dont want to be online at all times! Google is going to steal my information!This is so crazy I won't even address it. If you really feel this way, then stop looking at Chromebooks because nobody is going to be able to sell you on them.4. 16 GB on-board storage is not enough!I will admit i was worried about switching to Cloud Storage, but Google Drive has been an excellent choice for me personally. I use many different computers throughout my day, and I have all my files with me once I sign into Chrome. If you have ever lost a flash drive before, you know my pain. With Google Drive, your data will never corrupt, and you will never lose your data. You may think that you do not have internet access at all times, but try to think of the last time you wanted to work on a file and you didn't have a wifi connection. the only time I have felt this is commuting to work, and driving long distances. If you use these times to work on documents then you will have to set your documents to be available offline.5. I use specific software that only runs on Windows!This is the only real reason I have ever heard not to buy a Chromebook. I understand plenty of people use Windows software to perform their work. This obviously won't be available for your Chromebook. However, ChromeRDP allows you to remote to any Windows PC. I use this frequently to remote to my work PC from home, and it is so easy to use.6. For only $250, this hardware must be junk!My Samsung Chromebook has had no issued so far, and I rarely hear of screen problems. The 16 GB SSD is almost invincible. These new SolidStateDrives are not like old, noisy, harddrives that would frequently break. With no moving parts in the laptop, we will see that hardware problems will be very very rare. Plus, Samsung is a high-quality hardware manufacturer so you should not be worried about this.My Rating of several Aspects:Processor and RAM Performance: 3/5  These are not designed to be maximum power PCs, but the chipset included is definitely sufficient for all of my needs.Screen: 3/5  The matte finish reduces glare, but I do miss the glossy finish that is so common now.Keyboard: 4/5  This is the best keyboard I have ever typed on, including Mac keyboards. The chiclet style keys are excellent and I type through essays quickly with few errors.Structural Sturdiness: 4/5  This is not the anodized aluminum that Macs are known for, no matter how visually similar it looks. But the strength of the case on this computer is impressive and competes with any <$600 laptop.Design: 5/5  This thing is great for a lightweight laptop that you can take anywhere. I bought a caselogic sleeve for about $15 and I can throw this in my backpack with books and anything else and never worry about it breaking.FINAL NOTE: THE NEW ACER C720 IS A MORE POWERFUL VERSION OF THIS SAMSUNG MODEL FOR THE SAME PRICE THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE. ALSO DO NOT WORRY ABOUT THE RISKS OF BUYING ANY CHROMEBOOK USED. THEY ARE EASILY RESET TO FACTORY SETTINGS.I can check email, listen to music, work on servers remotely via SSH or Chrome RDP, write essays with Google docs or the FREE MICROSOFT WORD AND EXCEL on skydrive.live.com that nobody seems to know about. These are free editions of Microsoft Office software produced by Microsoft. And you can access all your work from anywhere with free storage space on Skydrive. If you dont k=know about these, check them out.

4930,"So, the chromebook pixel came out today, and honestly I don't get it. Unless Google has something crazy planned for I/O in May, the Samsung series 3 is what you want. This value proposition is unbeatable. You're getting a shockingly high quality laptop for 250 dollars.BuildIt looks absolutely excellent. Many reviews rave about it's lightness, and I was somewhat worried it would feel too light, to the extent of feeling cheap. It's almost perfect.KeyboardSome will love this keyboard, I think it doesn't have quite enough resistance, but it's nice enough and gets the job done. I'm a little spoiled coming from a mechanical keyboard.TrackpadBig enough, quality enough, responsive and has good two finger scrolling. A little loud on clicks, but if that's an issue, you may just become a tapper and not a clicker.DisplayFrom reading the reviews I thought the display would be horrible. In reality I think it's quite excellent. I prefer a matte display, and this one is a perfectly fine matte display with enough brightness and enough viewing angles.Battery lifeOne of the prime selling points of this device, and for me almost any other. The battery life on this computer is superb. Much better than my nexus 7, much more capable too. Even with decent brightness, it seems like this thing lasts forever compared to my windows 8 upgraded pc.What it boils down to is, what are you looking for? Honestly, when was the last time you were on a PC and not connected to the internet? What applications do you use that aren't available online? Have you tried experimenting with chrome webapps to see if there is an adequate alternative out there to your favorite offline application? I've found that everything I need and more is available as a webapp and have been impressed with the level of capability available online for free. It's truly amazing. I highly recommend this product as well as the chrome OS. Very impressed.

4931,"I was going to purchase this from Amazon but the price went up. So I went to Best Buy to get it for $250.I have a MacBook Pro but wanted a netbook for classes that was light and convenient for on the go. My iPad mini is too difficult for typing notes.I was able to use a MacBook Pro silicone keyboard protector for the Chromebook, but I had to trim the edges. They keys are very much like a Mac's, which is another reason I decided to go with this instead of a typical Acer netbook. Much easier for me on switching between laptops.I ignored any of the poor reviews about the video playback because I didn't need that. The screen is odd to me. The closest thing I can think of to describe it is that it's like an LCD TV. Very matte but sharp in a way. Check it out at Best Buy to see if it bothers you or not. The Acer Chromebook has a glass-like screen which I would have preferred. But this had better specs: 6.5 hrs battery life + 2.4 lbs vs. 3 hrs + 3 lbs.I wasn't too familiar with Chrome OS, but I had the browser on my Macbook. It syncs up pretty well and all of my bookmarks/apps/history/cache transferred nicely (the browser is attached to the google account you use for the browser/GDrive). I'd recommend downloading and playing around with the Chrome Browser to see if you are okay using it. The OS seems to be completely based around the Chrome browser and its apps.The speakers are surprisingly strong and are under the laptop near the front feet. Gives it a surround-sound feeling.It's somewhat difficult for me to open compared to my MacBook. I'm still looking for a good cover to put on this, but I suppose I'll have to wait until the market share goes up.Overall, I absolutely love my new laptop and Google Drive is working great for my note-taking.Hope this helps!*UPDATE*I've been having problems with the machine not waking up from sleep. The power button is lit but the screen is asleep. I had to hold the power button until the machine turns off... and then turn it back on.Many others have this problem and the current go-arounds are switching to the beta channel (since Google is aware of the problem and apparently fixed it in the next update) or logging off before you close it (which I prefer... but looking forward to the update).My two cents:Keep in mind that this, much like other programs, is a work in progress and requires a certain amount of patience and perspective. Google isn't afraid to have people experimenting with the products to make them better. Contrary to other unhappy users, I don't feel as if Google/Samsung have cheated me in any way and I think the pros are outweighing the cons. I mean, why do people think there are always new versions of everything? Mac OSX 10.8.2, Windows 8, etc. There will always be bugs that will have to be worked out and Chrome is a young OS. If anything, I feel like we're helping the OS reach its potential.*UPDATE* (6 months later)I haven't had problems with the Chromebook since the sleep problem and that was fixed a week after I wrote that.The Chromebook has been working just fine!

4932,"Simply put anything that I would have to say about this computer is almost rendered irrelevant due to the $250 price tag. At $250 for a brand new fully functional laptop with no moving parts and an OS, this computer is simply unrivaled. Arguably the price is the entire reason you would purchase this computer. Basically, if you want a nice little netbook that you are for the most part only going to browse the web with look no further, it's hard to have any regrets when you're only paying $250 for a laptop. As for how it works, it works well. It loads up pages quickly, you can stream HD video, and you can even hook it up to your HDTV through it's HDMI port on the back! The HDMI feature worked well when I used it for streaming video so this basically fills that niche for a nice little multi-media web browser.

4933,"I have been using my Chromebook for about 2 weeks and I really like it. I am a student and really enjoy the portability and simplicity of the device.Pros:Very Good Trackpad and Keyboard. I was expecting the trackpad to be slow and non-responsive. Much to my surprise, it was a delight to use. Multi-touch gestures like two finger scrolling worked very well. My only complaint was that it would sometimes interpret my clicks as right clicks in certain situations. The keyboard was also very nice. I own a Samsung Series 7 17-inch notebook with a very nice keyboard. This Chromebook has just as good of keyboard.Quick Startup Time. The machine boots in less than 10 seconds everytime. Very nice for students like me who don't want to deal with a PC or Mac that boots in a minute or two.Portability. At 11 inches and 2.4 pounds, this device takes up almost no space in my backpack. Very easy to lug around.Chrome Browser. This device at its heart is a web-browsing device and it does this extremely well. Sometimes, certain websites will be a bit jerky when scrolling through them and sometimes the RAM will get bogged down by too many pages but for the most part its a joy to use. If you come in with the mindset that this is solely a web-browsing device, you will really enjoy this device.Battery Life. 6 hours of use is easily attainable with this device. Sometimes 7 if you aren't watching movies.Cons:Low-Quality Display. Whites and blacks are not very pretty or deep. Picture gets washed out if not looking at the device from the proper angle. Pretty much you get what you pay for. Not a dealbreaker, but something you may want to see in person before you buy. Videos look decent though.Chrome Web Store. The Chrome store has a decent amount of apps but there are many things that just aren't possible with this device. Any game or graphically intensive app either won't run on this device or will run slowly. Also, because this device is ARM-based and not x86-based, several applications on the store don't work on this device. Most notably Netflix won't run on the Chromebook. They say that they are trying to change it, which I'm sure they will soon, but its still a bummer.Build Quality. This device is all plastic which keeps the weight down but doesn't feel at all like a premium product. If you push the bottom, middle part of the display on the back, it bends very easily. Again this isn't a deal breaker as the device never feels like it will break. You just get what you pay for.Speed. Because of the ARM chip and small amount of RAM, there isn't quite as snappy as a lot of modern computers. This is completely understandable for the price but you shouldn't buy this device thinking it will be a speed demon.Overall, this is an absolutely fantastic value. I bought it mostly for watching Youtube videos and taking notes which this device does very well. It constantly surprises me at how capable it is for all of my day to day needs. It's tough for me to recommend this computer as someone's only computer because there are certain apps like iTunes and Skype that are crucial for many people and won't run on this device. It's a great secondary computer to take around with you in your backpack.

For someone who uses his computer almost exclusively for browsing and email, this is perfect. It is light, simple to use, and has a great keyboard. The Chrome OS is completely intuitive, fast, and starts up in seconds.Like many others, I've been waiting a long time for a netbook that doesn't run Windows, and there was no way I was going to learn Windows 8 just to browse the web. I haven't tried watching movies on it yet, which is another thing I use computers for, but I have my iPad for that if it doesn't go well.Overall, an outstanding value and one of a series of products which will likely drive Windows out of the netbook market within a year or two. Be very very afraid, Steve Ballmer.

4940,"Great concept theses Chromebooks. I liked this Samsung very much during the first 11 months I used it, then the keyboard stop responding. I sent it to Samsung (great customer service), they repaired and worked fine for three weeks then the screen would go blank and you needed to turn the computer off to get it back working. In other words the functioning of screen became erratic,it would go blank unexpectedly and you have to go to the routine of turning the computer on and off. By this time the computer was out of warranty and too expensive to repair. In summary if you don't mind to spend $200 for a computer that last one year, go ahead and buy it you will be please. For me I prefer to find a new one that last longer even if I have to pay a little more. At the present I am considering the Toshiba for $329. What I know for sure is that I will continue using Chromebooks, they are a pleasure to use.

4944,"The latest Chromebook from Samsung based on ARM processor is a great bargain at $250. Very solid keyboard, light, long lasting battery, nice looking when closed.I wish the display would be better quality. I would gladly pay extra $50 for a higher res 12'' IPS display instead what comes in the package. Display is matte but not very bright and not very contrasty, so the the matte quality goes to waste in bright sun anyway. It does not reflect your surroundings but since it is not an IPS display you end up constantly adjusting the screen to face you perfectly. Otherwise contrast is lost very quickly. How quickly, you ask? Well, if I am sitting on a sofa with Chromebook on my lap, even slight change of my head position is enough for contrast going way down. It usually results in whole screen getting darker, the dark areas all becoming black blobs and colors desaturating. Also, since Samsung put an 11.6'' display and full size keyboard, there is a lot of wasted space around the display. It frankly looks cheap. That's why this laptop won't turn anyone's head when opened. The resolution of 1366x768 results in text not overly sharp, especially for aged eyes. 1600x900 would be much better.The touchpad is a bit cramped. I understand that it is a limitation of the laptop size, but it does result in need to constantly adjust your fingers position so you won't bump against touchpad border. I am also not a big fan of the location of the ports. All of them, except SD card slot are on the back of Chromebook. This only works when Chromebook is set on the flat surface like table. Put it on you lap and you will risk breaking the ports since power and USB plugs will be vulnerable to any movement or adjusting your position.Speaking of the SD card slot, the design of it bewilders me. When you insert your card in the port it ends up sticking half-way out of the port, like in USB card readers. This is first time I am seeing this implementation in laptop form. Again, extremely vulnerable and easy to break your card and possibly damage the port if you bump the side against any surface, even soft. This also pretty much precludes you from putting an SD card in and leaving it permanently in the Chromebook as a much needed extra storage.Otherwise, Wi-Fi antenna is good. Google claims that it is dual-band dual-antenna design but I found that it is not very speedy. My Kindle Fire HD beats Chromebook handily in both throughput and range. Speakers are very weak. The worst speakers from all the laptops that I used. It is on the same range as typical tablet speakers. Again, Kindle Fire HD showed that one does not need to have big shell to produce big sound. Overall I would rate hardware at two stars but since the price is so affordable, I would bump one star up.Now as for software. First thing that strikes you is an instant on. The moment I pull up the display it is on and ready to work. Wi-Fi takes about 5 seconds to reestablish connection but by the time you unlock your Chromebook and click any link on the browser it is already on. Chromebook comes with the best PC browser in Google Chrome. Almost all PC extensions work without glitch. My Chrome is equipped with AdBlock, LastPass, ProxySwitch, SpeedDial, Camelizer, XMarks BookMark Sync and others and all of them work on Chromebook the same way as on PC. Some specialized extensions like Clickability Portal do not work. The combination of the Samsung Exynos 5 Dual core CPU, Chrome browser and 2GB of RAM results in great performance. Few dynamic HTML heavy sites lag a little but overall I can not complain. Multi-tabbing works perfectly too. I often have dozen+ sites open at once and usually do not experience any performance degradation.Now, why I call Chrome OS as half-baked. Because it is. First of all, IMO Chrome is a dead-end as OS. Android can do all the same things better and is so much more. Google also does not put much effort in maintaining and updating an OS. Example? Well, how about touchpad gestures. Chrome OS comes with total of 5 gestures! That's right. There is no back or forward gesture, there is no zoom in or zoom out gesture. All you have is move cursor, click, right click, scroll and drag-and-drop. That is it, folks. I have Windows 8 laptop and it takes me an hour just to familiarize myself with all possible gestures, including three finger and four finger gestures. Android and iOS both come with multi-gesture friendly displays. Chromebook relies heavily on keyboard shortcuts, of which there is almost a hundred possible combinations with Ctrl, Alt or Shift keys. Again, great keyboard, so if you are working on your Chromebook at the desk there are no complains. But if you browse Internet or playing some lightweight games on the sofa, you would try to minimize keyboard interaction and rely more on touchpad and the limited functionality of what it can do in Chrome OS is evident compared to all other modern OS. I can connect mouse and enable one of the Chrome mouse gestures extensions but again, it only works on the desk. You just don't use mouse on your lap or anywhere else.Then comes multimedia playback or lack of. YouTube works just fine. No complaints there. Amazon videos can only be watched in standard resolution. It looks ugly. Netflix does not work. Now, many will say that both Google and Netflix are working on the fix and it should be available shortly. Call me realist. I've seen many times before how the 'shortly' projections drag for months and months and at the end of the day Netflix does not have much incentive to be in any hurry because of the negligible market share that Samsung ARM-based Chromebook have. Local video playback is also lousy. Chromebook comes with only a handful of codec and formats supported and outside or re-encoding each and every video in Chromebook friendly format, you will find a very sporadic support. Many of my videos do not play at all. Sometimes if I change file extension to one of Chromebook supported ones the video would work but not the sound. In other words it's unreliable at best and frustrating to no means at worst. Coupled with mediocre display and worse speakers, if you are planning to use it for any entertainment purposes - don't.Google Docs are adequate. I would rate it the lowest from the list of MS Office, Libre and Open Office alternatives. Google Docs are sufficient for some undemanding word or presentation prep work but lacks pretty much any advanced features. Since it is Cloud-based Office suite (you can work with Google Docs offline too), there is an instant save as you type, so I can work on any document, close the display, go to cafe across the street, reopen it and continue working without any loss of data.Where Chromebook shines is in Google Services integration. It comes with 100GB of Cloud storage for two years free of charge, courtesy of Chromebook promotion. The promotion is only valid for the one user and one Chromebook. In other words, if you plan to have to users working on Chromebook, only one can claim the extra space. If you buy couple of Chromebooks and try to claim space on both of them, single user can only claim the first promotion but not any subsequent. If you sell your Chromebook or gift it after claiming the space, it can not be reclaimed by any other user. So be aware of this. Chromebook comes with Gmail set up and ready to use. There is even offline functionality, so you can look at older Emails and reply without necessary connecting to the Internet. next time you reconnect, Chromebook will automatically sync all the Emails.Chrome App Store is very limited compared to Android marketplace or iOS App Store. I would say it's on the level with B&N Nook store. Which is, on other words, nothing to write about. Most of the apps are nothing more then URL links to the vendor web site. Netflix, Pandora, even Youtube do not have any specialized interface. So I do not think of these as Apps, because I much rather have them in my Bookmarks then exposed from the bottom menu. None of the apps go automatically into full screen mode. This is another are where Chrome OS lacks severely compared to all other modern OS. Even Microsoft has recognized with Windows 8 that full screen mode is very beneficial when you want to focus on the primary application and give it as much screen real estate as possible. Google Chrome OS lives in the browser with all of the extra bars both on top and bottom that eat into already very limited vertical space. To switch to full screen there is an obscure Shift-Maximize keyboard shortcut. Good luck executing it when on a sofa with Chromebook on your lap.Overall I really can not recommend this laptop. The price is right and the keyboard is excellent (back lighting would help it even more) but the rest of the package just is not there. If you want something very portable and ready to work with limited Google Docs suite, it's fine. For everything else there are better alternatives. General Web Browsing with occasional Email - tablets are better because of touchscreen and better fitted apps. Entertainment - tablets are in it's own class. Productivity - Windows-based laptops are way more flexible. Gaming - depending on casual or hardcore, either tablets or PC are better in all respects.

4946,"The hardware is quite usable. The keyboard and track pad are not bad. The screen in not great but for the price, it's OK. It is light and solid feeling.However, I bought this because I wanted to use it to access a Citrix virtual desktop at work. There is a Citrix client for Chromebook, so I thought it might work. Sorry, but it does not. Reason one that it fails is that Google does not support WPA2-Enterprise authentication. So, in my workplace, I cannot get on the network. I had our tech support guy try with me, but a little searching revealed that no one has a workaround for this yet. I would have thought that a device which is 100% dependent on Wifi for doing anything at all would support a much wider range of authentication protocols.  Then we used an unauthorized WiFi base station hooked up to our lan, just to try out Citrix. Try as we might, we could not connect. There seem to be Citrix server modifications that need to be installed to make access via the Chrome client workable. That is not going to happen real soon in our shop.So, besides those two failings, it could be a reasonable device if all you want to do it use your Google web apps. I guess Google is not interested in better support for things like enterprise networking and Citrix environments because they cannot spy on you in these situations.

4950,"A review of the new $ 249 Google Chrome BookGoogle has introduced a new portable computer - they call it the perfect additional computer - and I see it as a paradigm shift in the role of a portable computing device.The new Samsung Chrome Book has an 11.6-inch full color display. It weights 2.42 lbs and is .7 inches thin. It has a battery life of over 6.5 hours and runs on a Samsung Dual processor with 100 GB of online Google Drive space. It features a web cam with USB and  HDMI ports and is Bluetooth compatible. It runs the  Chrome OS, which means it has Google apps built in, and is priced at $249.I think it's one of the most remarkable product introductions I've seen in my 35 years working in the PC industry.This new  Chrome Book re-defines what a portable computer can do and how it can be used, and is completely based on the concept of Cloud Computing . It works right out of the box, has no moving parts, and has built-in anti-virus protection.Google has created a complete infrastructure for cloud computing; Google Chrome browser for surfing the web, Google email, online google docs application software compatible with MS Office apps, google drive to store whatever documents you want in the cloud, free downloadable apps such as google voice for phone calls and video conferencing with webcam, and dozens of other applications. And of course the Google Search Engine. All the software you need is in the Google Cloud.I've had 5 portable computers over the years and I bought each one to be an additional computer to my office computers.  But now you don't need a bulky expensive laptop computer with a big hard disk and Microsoft Office installed on it.I had also bought an IPad as a possible new portable computing device.  Trying to use my Ipad for email and type on the glass was maddening. I couldn't get it to print as I didn't have an Apple Airprint compatible printer, and I was shocked to learn that I could only buy music and media through Apple Itunes.I could easily print to any of my printers with the Chrome Book, it has a great real keyboard, and I can buy anything from anywhere - Amazon or whatever vendor I can get the best prices from.Placed side by side, The Macbook Air and The Google Chrome Book look almost like twins in design, keyboard and screen size.With the Chrome Book, I can surf the web, watch Youtube videos, play games, check my email, video chat, make free phone calls, and If I want to create a letter or a spreadsheet I just use Google docs and I can store them online in Google drive. If there are files on my main computers I want to be able to access with my Chrome Book, I can upload those files to my online Google drive, and be able to access and edit them.The new Samsung Chrome Book defines the new world of Cloud Computing and provides virtually everyone easy access to this world at an astoundingly low price. I also feel that many people could use this as their only computing device.For Raw Bytes, this is Frank DelaneyRaw Bytes Computer NewsKPBX Spokane Public Radio FM 91.1 National Public Radio

4951,"The Samsung Chromebook, which I'm actually using to write this review, is the best thing I've bought so far. For about $250, I was able to buy a laptop that was exactly what I needed. If you're the type of person who uses a computer to browse on the internet, or you're just a big Google fan, then you are going to love the Chromebook. As a student, I don't bring my Chromebook to school because we're given cheap laptops to use. So, in terms of assignments and such, I use Google Drive to make documents like writing papers, essays, etc. This way I can start an assignment at school and without having to transport a laptop I can access and finish that same assignment at home on my Chromebook. Yes, you can do this with laptops other than the Chromebook, but I still wanted to make that point.  If you're looking for a laptop that has all the bells and whistles that an overpriced Apple product may provide, then you may want to reconsider the Chromebook. Before buying mine, I often found myself comparing the Samsung Chromebook with the Apple Macbook Air, even though I'm not an Apple fan (that's a whole other story) and the fact that these two laptops are in totally different leagues. I do admit, though, that the Apple Macbook Air is a very nice product in terms of design and what not, but it seemed that it had too much for what I really needed because I was just looking for a laptop that I could use to go on Facebook, check my email, etc. I did look at a few tablets, but I wanted to be able to do school work so a keyboard was definitely needed. Since my purchase, I've found that the Chromebook is really just a tablet with a keyboard which was perfect! Although dubbed a laptop, the Chromebook acts like a tablet due to the fact that you have applications, which you can easily access from the Chrome Web Store and/or Google Playstore, and it has limited space on the computer itself (although you can always store files on Google Drive). However, you can do things on the Chromebook that you can't on a tablet. For instance, my Dad owns a tablet and when trying to access Hulu, it requires that you have Hulu Plus to watch its content while the Chromebook doesn't have a problem. I know this may not be a defining factor in considering what you want, but for me that was pretty important.  When I first bought this laptop, Netflix initially didn't work on Chromebooks. Since then, the problem has been fixed and I've been using Netflix steadily for the past few months.  In terms of the laptop itself, and not on what it does, I've had absolutely no problems with the design. I really like the keyboard, where all letters are in lowercase (neat and different than those of other laptops), a search key replaces the standard caps lock key, and you have all the ""shortcut keys"" at the very top of the keyboard with options like full screen, brightness, sound, refresh button, and multiple tabs key. The keyboard is really nice, though my only complaint would be that the keys don't light up in the dark so if you're using the Chromebook in an area of limited light, then you have to use the light from the screen to see what you're typing. The mouse is really easy to use, you can scroll up and down pages by using two fingers on the mouse pad. The screen isn't glossy like the Macbook Air, but I found that its matte finish is much better because you don't have as much reflection on the screen. The speaker quality is pretty decent for its size and for having the speakers be on the bottom of the laptop (but the curvature design of the bottom makes it so it doesn't get too muffled). Although the laptop can be easily susceptible to scratches, it still has a sleek design and finish and I honestly don't mind the scratches on mine because I didn't buy it for what it looks like but more of what it can do.  There is a standard 3.5 mm audio input on the side with usb ports, hdmi cable port, and charger port on the back. There's also a decent front facing camera, but if you're one to take selfies, I advise that you use a cell phone or an actual camera if you want the best quality. The laptop is incredibly light and it really does turn on in less than 10 seconds, so if a restart is needed for an update and such, it doesn't take much time to do so.  SUMMARY: I didn't mean to go so in depth, but I honestly was so excited to write this review because I've been praising my Chromebook for the past 6 months and figured it was time to tell the world. If you are looking for a laptop primarily for internet use then don't look any farther because the Chromebook is perfect for you. It's light, and with a case you can take it just about anywhere. It really does turn on in about 8 seconds, so they weren't lying. The battery lasts for hours, so I don't need to recharge that often. However, because of its unique operating system and being heavily focused on using wi-fi, if you don't have wireless, then the Chromebook will be pretty useless. Yes, there are some offline apps you can use, but let me repeat, only some.  SUMMARY OF SUMMARY (this is it, I promise): Samsung claims that their Chromebook is for everyone but it definitely isn't. Before buying mine, I did a LOT of research and took a chance on the Chromebook and I have been very happy with it so far. I advise you to do some research on your own, and if you think that the Chromebook is right for you, then go for it.

4952,"Wow, I feel that after three years this little laptop thing is worth some props. We have many options in our household yet the chromebook always seems to be in use. My now 12 year old prefers it to her Ipad and Surface Pro for anything other than schoolwork or Face timing. Which is high praise from a computer savy 12 year old. It's travelled well, dropped, lost, found, scratched but never forgotten. We still drain the entire battery every day at least once! We will miss (replace) it when it dies as it has become part of the family, but it's still working like new now.

4953,"If you are looking for a fully-powered computer that will use Microsoft Office, video games, etc., this is not the product for you. People who are rating this product poorly clearly did no research on what the Chrome OS system is, and that is entirely their fault.This is a great computer for what it is. I view it was a much more productive tablet. I have a 17 inch real laptop and simply cannot carry it with me. Instead, I bring my Chromebook everywhere to do work or for actual ""laptop"" situations. It is almost useless without WiFi, but that's kind of the point of the device. It is extremely light. Its keyboard reminds me of Mac keyboard (which I love, despite being a PC person). The battery lasts for a long time.It can occasionally be a little slow when I have lots of tabs open, etc., but again, for the price, I think that's reasonable. I do all of my work on Drive, so if you're the same way, this is the perfect device.

4954,"My mac died. It took some data with it. Not much, but I was annoyed.I guess I could have gotten the icloud, or a time machine thingy. Effort/money. Bah.My mac cost 2000$ and lasted 6 years, 333 dollars a year. If this chromebook lasts 2 years that'll be 125 a year, and I can throw it in the trash and not lose any data since it uses the google cloud idrive jobby. Did I mention the free google drive space? That comes with it. You cannot beat this price, people!Here's a list of reasons it is superior to my old laptop, in no particular order.- it's lighter. My work laptop weighs so much more, this thing is not noticable.- it's (thermally) cooler- I can hook the hdmi up to my TV and watch netflix- the battery seems to last a long time- no caps lock key, i've always hated the caps lock.- no 'f' keys. ""F""- them! What is ""F4""? A worthless computer shibboleth for lording over users and their ignorant comrades. There are dedicated keys for windowing, and other settings.- The keystrokes feel wonderful. In fairness apple switched to these keys.- no optical drive. I don't need that any more.- no need to hook up my phone to get photos. I push them into the google drive when I take them. They are available whenever I open the chromebook lid.- The trackpad is .. I dunno, supple. flicking around, clicking and right clicking are so nice. I hate the dell trackpads more than ever.- There's no such thing as crapware on this thing.Here's a list of CONS!- google docs doesn't keep the cursor in the right position if you ctrl+ (zoom) the window. Pretty bush league!!- If you open a document in gdocs, it opens a google drive window. Then clicking the document opens another gdoc window. Three windows! Duh.Since these cons only have to do with google docs, I can still give this thing 5 stars. The audio jack is a bit stiff when I tried [un]plugging a std 1/4 inch tip stereo headphone in. Is that a problem? No.Wait, I thought of a con.- you can't see a calendar by clicking on the time. You get dumped into the settings interface for picking your damn time zone. Stick a freaking calendar on that thing google! Of course, they won't because they want to hawk their stupid calendar app.Still, 5 stars.

4956,"Updated review:An update in the OS fixed my problem and it now works well. With a reliable wifi connection, the Chromebook is great. The instant boot time makes this the computer I reach for the most often. It's light weight and long battery life makes it a great travel companion.Printing is a pain though. It's always a huge waste of time where things don't work and you need to try random things before things print. For this task, I save time by using other computers. I'll give this device stars if they can make the printing experience less horrendous.Past Review:I really wanted to like the Chromebook, with its instant on, maintenance-free, low-overhead advantage, but in reality, I find myself frustrated with its spotty ability to connect to the internet (even though none of my other devices have this problem). The problem with a web-based OS is that it's completely useless without a connection. And during the times that it can connect, I oftentimes have to refresh the tab before the page renders (otherwise, I get an error about the website not being available).The pages load very very slowly, too. So I find myself booting up my real computer to get things done faster.I definitely would not recommend this to anyone.

4957,"I bought this Chromebook in August 2013.  I really liked it at first but it got really hot after a few hour's use on the bottom side of the machine.  I also noticed that the exterior of the machine is very cheaply made and the card reader slot never really closed correctly.The mousepad stopped functioning well in May 2014 but was still usable but only to click on the screen.  I had to use the keyboard to highlight, cut, and copy text.Then, a month ago, I noticed the battery life went from 8 hours to 1 hour.  Today, 13 months after purchase, the battery will not hold a charge at all and the machine will not even function when plugged in.  I called the local repair place and they said it would cost $99 in labor to replace the battery in addition to the cost of the battery-- over $150 to repair.Summary: September 2013 worked fine but overheated.  Thirteen months later: completely unusable product that won't even power on.

4958,"I gave this product 5 stars despite its clear limitations. No one is saying that the Samsung Chromebook can do everything that your Macbook Air can, but I will say that it can do most of the things that students use their laptops for, and for a fraction of the price. When on the go and not connected to wifi I use the offline docs editing feature and do whatever writing I need to get done. If I want to make a document look nice I'll use the Chrome Remote Desktop app to fullscreen into my headless Windows box sitting at home. It feels like I'm on the desktop. I'll open the Gdoc from the web browser on that computer, then paste the text into Word and format it.I love this thing's physical features. It's incredibly light and thin, and it's true that it's not as pretty as an Air. There's a lump on the top where the hinge for the display is, and the plastic scratches super easily. I don't care one bit. The ports on the back aren't as convenient as they would be on the side, but it's what they had to do to make it so thin and cheap. The screen, when closed, presses against the keys and picks up any finger residue. That's one of the main issues, but it's a price I'm happy to pay.I was using the Google SR-48 prototype Chromebook prior to this one, and the biggest complaint I have is battery life. It's 6 hours and more than enough for me but I feel less invincible than I did before, as the battery would last forever.My bottom line: If you're able to adapt to the Google way of doing things and jive with it, you can get any productivity task done on this machine for a measly amount of money. It's a fantastic product, miles better than stupid netbooks and a grand cheaper than sexy Ultrabooks. Good for any student. Perfect for writing - they keyboard feels great! And of course it's fine as a web browser. It will run Netflix and Youtube just fine, though some web protocols don't run as fast as they ought.

4959,"After years of lugging around a ""travel laptop"" I have finally found the way to get work done while on a trip. The Samsung Chromebook is light: the ""instant on"" is incredibly fast and OMG - the ability to have an actual keyboard to get work done puts this head and shoulders above a tablet! The only minor drawback I've encountered so far is that I cannot have both of my gmail accounts running simultaneously: it is necessary to log off one in order to view the other. Apart from that, there is no reason not to purchase this device.  Enjoy!

4960,"We just got the Samsung chromebook's assigned to us where I work. It's a good machine with decent battery life and decent performance. I also own an Acer C720 chromebook for personal use so I can compare the two. The screens and keyboard are the same and size and weight are just about the same too. The C720 however definitely has better battery life and feels more peppy thanks to the Haswell processor. Between the two I would definitely choose the Acer since it's cheaper, faster and has better battery life. I do like the Samsung though. For what I do with it here at work, it performs just fine.

4961,"I am a heavy weight user of all things Google, but to migrate to a Chromebook from a regular laptop is still a big step for someone who has been heavily into IT/programming/heavy software use for many years. It was a step that I wanted to take because I now do everything in the cloud, and have an Android phone and tablet.So, the limitations are:- Can only print to Google cloud ready printers. Or classic printers that are connected to a PC.YOU CANNOT DIRECTLY CONNECT A USB PRINTER TO A CHROMEBOOK, which renders my older Wi-Fi/Bluetooth printer, that is not cloud compatible, useless with my Chromebook. Fortunately, I can print to my husbands B&W laser printer, but not my awesome color photo printer.- If you are planning on using this to replace a windows laptop or tower, you may need an external monitor, keyboard and mouse.I have a Logitech wireless keyboard and mouse that uses the same USB dongle (Logitech's Unifying hardware that can connect up to 6 peripherals to one USB dongle.). This is great to save one of the two USB ports. I would have a printer in the other port... if it worked, but instead it has my phone charger in it. Have also ordered a 20"" Samsung HDMI monitor. This Chromebook does have an HDMI port.- New keyboard shortcuts to learn, and some standard keys not there.E.g. delete - you have to press Alt+Backspace. This is pretty easy to get used to, but not a problem if you have an external keyboard, where all of the regular keys work just the way they should.The number pad on the external wireless keyboard does not work with the built in calculator app on the Chromebook. The number pad works in general text situations only. That's too bad.- Video camera is not awesome.But it works and is acceptable. However - Google Chromebook DOES NOT SUPPORT SKYPE. That's right, you cannot use Skype on this baby. Instead, you are encouraged to use Google Hangouts. I would love to, but none of my chat friends are on there - ha.Those limitations might be deal breakers for some, but I am still happy with my Samsung Chromebook. If I could print to a classic printer without using another PC, I would have given 5 stars. For the money, ease of use and portability, I don't regret being an owner.

4962,"The item was advertised as coming with 2 years of free Verizon 3G service. I received the chromebook from amazon and could not figure out anything about the 3G service. There were no instructions about it. I contacted amazon and was told to contact customer support at Samsung. I contacted Samsung and they said I needed to contact Verizon about having a SIM card sent to me. I contacted Verizon and they said to contact amazon.com about not receiving the SIM Card. What a mess. Everyone is clueless and amazon.com customer service has been terrible in dealing with the problem. Save yourself some grief and DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT.

4963,"I've had several desktop (actually floor top because they've all been towers I put on the floor) PCs over the last couple decades and never needed a portable unit til now. So I read through the most useful customer reviews here and watched several youtube videos from knowledgeable sources. I then went to Best Buy to try it out but was very disappointed when I found out from an employee that they didn't have any demo model. I decided I had enough information to make the buy without having any way to try it out first.I received my unit last week from newegg since I have a free ShopRunner account and it has been everything I had expected from all the sources I had. The next day I was reading through Yahoo News and they had a link to a LiveScience article titled ""The 10 Best Bargains in Tech Today"" and the Samsung Chromebook Series 3 was the first item listed. I felt like all the homework I had done paid off.Update:After only 4 months, the touchpad stopped working. Just got the unit back from Texas. I was thinking they would just send me a remanufactured one but they replaced the keyboard/touchpad so I don't have to change my wireless router access list. I had been carrying it around when it was on with one hand under the touchpad and I could feel the plastic case flexing. Maybe I'll start using 2 hands over the outside edges.

4965,"Agree with the overwhelmingly positive reviews. Size, portability, keyboard, cost, browsing and bootup speed were musts for me, and it completely lives up to my expectations. I LOVE how it turns on in two seconds, has no fan, doesn't get hot, and doesn't cost so much that I would lose a lot of sleep if something happened to it. And if it did, and I got a new one (which I would), it would be exactly the same as my past Chromebook upon the first login bc of Cloud Storage and syncing. Amazing. I think the build quality is plenty sturdy, the screen is plenty resolute, and I have never had any trouble getting wifi where available.I've grown to love the dedicated search button instead of Ctrl T for a new tab, and have gotten sick nasty at using the back, forward keyboard buttons for browsing. Touchpad is good, clicking easy, scrolling is good, two-finger right click is responsive 100%.One sentiment I haven't seen mentioned often is how it forces to you explore some of Chrome's capabilities through extensions and apps, an eye-opening experience for someone who had been using Chrome as primary browser for years. This experience has been a pleasure, and I am continually impressed with capability of ""just a browser"". Cloud storage in Google Drive is fast and easy. Set it as an extension button at the upper right of the screen, and voila, anything saved anytime, to any of your devices with internet connection. Silverbird for Twitter, Evernote, and Any.do are also terrific extensions. And if you're not using Google News yet, get on board.The apps are surprisingly useful as well. On PC, I've used extensively GIMP and Photoshop for image manipulation and photo editing, and used REAPER and Audacity a lot for music recording and editing. Sumo Paint does everything (layers, masks, lassos, plenty of effects) that I used in GIMP. For music production, I'm between Audiosauna and Audiotool, which both seem to have all the capability I had in REAPER and Audacity. Easy to hook up mic, preamp through USB, and start recording. A BIG thing I've noticed with both of those is how surprisingly peppy they are, which I assume is due to the heavy lifting being done on a more powerful machine somewhere outside of my Chromebook. Regardless, that's quite all right with me. Oh yeah, and they're free too.I use Google Remote Desktop for the rare occasions I need something on my PC which I keep on at home. Works like a champ. At first I went through Excel remotely for pivot tables and more of the heavy lifting operations, but now I've realized it really is just as easy to do in Google Docs, and have all but abandoned the remote desktop, except in cases I need a picture or something from my PC hard drive that hasn't been uploaded to Cloud.The only two downsides for me (disclaimer: I don't do heavy gaming on my computer, or anywhere else...). 1) It's an impractical device if you don't have an internet connection. But there is literally no place I ever want to browse for any length of time, or do work, that doesn't have wifi. So for me this isn't a downside, which leaves only one real downside for my using experience...no Delete button. I'm getting over it, but I still miss it sometimes...Pluses far outweigh minuses. Great machine for anyone.Oh and for all the peeps wondering about delivery time since out of stock online. It's currently taking about 15 days from order placement to doorstep.

4967,"We just got the Samsung Chromebook yesterday as we needed a 2nd laptop, but didn't want to spend a lot of money. This is not something you will install programs as there are no programs to install, which means no patches or patches for the patches. This is Google Chrome. What does that mean? Well everything you already do now on the web, you do here. Everything is stored on the cloud. So why do you need/want this? Well if you have multiple people who use a laptop or pc, this is an excellent alternative. You do have to be connected and you do have to have a gmail account.The pros:1 - It boots up in 8 seconds. Yes 8 seconds. You don't even hit the power button. You just open it and presto.2 - It's quiet.3 - You think 11.6"" might be too small, but honestly it's not.4 - Yes the hard drive is 16 gig, but keep this in mind it's a ssd, so no moving parts. And everything is stored online.5 - Battery life is pretty awesome.I don't really have any cons. That caps lock key that we are all used to is now a dedicated search button. And to right click you use two fingers and touch the touch pad.Other than that, for what it's purpose is and what it does and for the price, this is perfect.To give you some idea what it really is, check out this video from Google.[...]

Beware:  it is nothing but a browser so if you are offline, you can do nothing but simple word processing.This computer just works.  I'm not a facebook junkie.  I don't watch much tv on a computer (I move to my large screen and comfy leather coach for that).  I generate content as much as I consume content on my computer.  So for that reason the tablets, nice as they are, just don't work for me.  I had a netbook that I run Jolli OS that I really liked, but the hardrive burnt out.  You can't replace that one anymore (it was $250).  This was the next cheapest thing.  What I love the most is the battery life, the incredibly fast boot time (instant if just asleep), and the portability.  The build is a little cheap, but not too bad.

I tried google-talk as recommended by a kind techie, but for me, it is confusing, does not work as well as Skype.  I purchased this unit in November of last year and after discovering its lack of Skype, instead of returning it,waited for Skype to be available.Moving on: Yes I use this laptop for most of the day, e-mail, online shopping, FB, the news, watching an online movie, etc.Please remember, this is a BROWSER, not a work laptop. With my HP netbook, and before that, the ACER netbook, I was able to use MS Word, etc., films, and of course Skype. Therefore think twice before you opt for Chromebook instead of a traditional netbook which gives you more choices.Or simply wait a little longer before purchasing chromebook as i am sure better versions will come soon.One new improvement: When I first purchased it, only amazon movies was working, but now Netflix is on board too, so you can watch films.True, this Samsung Chromebook is light and springs to life lightning quick after it was asleep (but the bottom gets hot, I place it on top CASE LOGIC QNS-111BLUE 11.6"" Molded Netbook Sleeve, as a barrier).The browser is finicky,jumpy,and unless you are careful, you will scoot all over the page but not where you want to be.Another positive is the unit is still working after 6 months of daily use.One suggestion: forego the 3G version and buy the cheaper wi-fi, fact is wi-fi is available in more and more places.Overall, not bad.
